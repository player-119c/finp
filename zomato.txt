The sighting of a Russian Su-57 Felon stealth fighter in Iran in late February 2025 was noteworthy for several reasons. One reason was that it served as an indirect reminder that Iran lags far behind many countries around it regarding the joint production of modern combat aircraft.
Satellite imagery _The War Zone_ showed the Su-57 parked at an airbase in Iran’s Bandar Abbas coastal region on Feb. 19 and Feb. 21. The aircraft was returning from Aero India 2025, where the Su-57 notably made an appearance beside a fifth-generation American F-35 Lightning II for the first time, which President Trump has proposed India buy.
Russia is the Su-57 in India, claiming production could begin as early as this year if New Delhi accepts. The deal could include technology transfers to India, which Russia boasts with the development of its indigenous, fifth-generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft, AMCA, which India ambitiously hopes will enter service in the mid-2030s.
New Delhi previously pulled out of a co-development project for the troubled Su-57 in 2018 after Russia had source codes for the jet’s flight computer. However, Moscow may prove much more willing to share such things now.
India has produced the twinjet, two-seater Su-30MKIs under license locally since 2002, building over 270 in the intervening decades—Moscow claims upgrades to this established production line could facilitate local production of the Su-57. In a sign that India wants to keep its enormous Flanker fleet flying for the foreseeable future, it recently ordered to replace aircraft lost in accidents over the years and for the existing fleet.

There are even prospects that these license-produced Flankers. New Delhi in February 2025 to help Malaysia with maintenance for its modest Su-30 fleet. Armenia also upgrading its tiny fleet of four Su-30SM jets.
During the Soviet era, India invested heavily in the MiG-21, with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited manufacturing a under license throughout the decades.
India isn’t the only powerful country near Iran with long experience co-producing aircraft.
Pakistan jointly developed and produced the single-engine JF-17 Thunder with its powerful ally China. It introduced the Block 3 variant in 2020, which boasts improved features, including radar. Pakistan recently won a deal to export an undisclosed number of JF-17s to Iran’s neighbor and rival Azerbaijan. Interestingly, in February 2025 that the two countries may jointly manufacture that combat aircraft.

Incidentally, Pakistan’s retaliation for an Iranian ballistic missile attack on its soil in January 2024 crewed fighter aircraft, aptly demonstrating how Islamabad has comparatively kept its air force up-to-date and capable while Tehran allowed its fighter fleet to decay in favor of ballistic missiles and drones.
Since the late 1980s, Turkish Aerospace Industries has built the venerable F-16 under license, specifically the Block 30/40/50 variants. In addition to building F-16s for the Turkish Air Force, which boasts the second-largest F-16 fleet worldwide, TAI also built 46 in the mid-1990s. TAI is presently developing the indigenous next-generation TF Kaan stealth jet. Azerbaijan has also with this project, and Arab Gulf heavyweights and the United Arab Emirates in joining.

The contrast between these projects and Iran’s lack of participation in any joint fighter jet development or production is striking. In the 1960s and 1970s, pre-revolutionary Iran built up one of the most powerful air forces in the wider region, with the sole exception of Israel. However, it did so primarily with off-the-shelf purchases and did not develop a substantial domestic arms industry capable of building fighters before the revolution. Still, its track record keeping sophisticated fourth-generation F-14s acquired during that period operational to the present day isn’t unimpressive.
Furthermore, Iran has technically built fighter jets, but these aren’t fourth-generation ones, as . In reality, these aircraft are little more than and upgrades of the lightweight, third-generation F-5. These are not remotely comparable to the Su-30MKI, JF-17 Block 3, or TAI-manufactured Block 50 F-16s.
(Incidentally, Turkey’s TAI built the Hurjet supersonic light combat aircraft and jet trainer, which will replace the Turkish Stars aerobatic team’s F-5s. Similarly, Spain its F-5s with that Turkish-built jet.)
Iran hopes to upgrade its aged air force in the near term by acquiring 4.5-generation Su-35 Flanker fighters from Russia. To date, it has only received a small number of subsonic Yak-130 trainer jets. Iranian media highlighted the Yak-130’s in Iran’s Zolfaqar exercise in late February 2025. During that exercise, a Yak-130 destroyed a target drone in coordination with two fourth-generation Soviet-era MiG-29A Fulcrum jets Tehran acquired all the way back in the early 1990s.

There are also recurring rumors on social media that Russia may allow Iran to produce Su-35s and Su-30s on its soil, although these remain unconfirmed and highly dubious. There has been recurring talk of Iran potentially following in India’s footsteps in locally manufacturing Su-30s for .
It’s conceivable that one day, Iran—under leadership that prioritizes the regular armed forces over a paramilitary narrowly focused on building drones and ballistic missiles—can catch up with these countries by finally developing and producing modern fighters. But for now, absent fundamental changes in its current leadership, Iran seems destined to continually lag behind these powers on that important front for the foreseeable future.

A massive American web of orbiting missile interceptors - celestial guardians perpetually circling the Earth - could in theory protect the United States against an all-out Russian nuclear attack, says a leading U.S. expert on nuclear and space weaponry and atomic warfare.
Three years into the Kremlin’s bombarding the West with threats to states aiding besieged Ukraine, the White House is moving toward constructing a futuristic shield of space weapons that could shoot down Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles.
A colossal network of these interceptors could be capable of destroying Russia’s entire armada of nuclear-tipped ICBMs if they were launched in an atomic blitzkrieg, says Todd Harrison, an internationally acclaimed scholar on space security and defense strategy at the American Enterprise Institute, a prominent Washington D.C.-headquartered think tank.
PROMOTED
Harrison told me in an interview that in a small-scale model he adapted, a web of 1900 interceptors patrolling 500 kilometers above the Earth could successfully shoot down a limited number of just-launched nuclear missiles in their “boost phase,” or first three minutes of flight.
Stopping each Russian ICBM within 180 seconds of its blast-off with a “hit-to-kill” counter-weapon is essential, Harrison explains, before the missile can eject a quiver of warheads, each of which could engulf an American city in nuclear flames.

Russia’s Soviet-designed missile SS-18, for example, “is a silo-based,10-warhead heavy ICBM first deployed in 1988,” say four atomic arms experts at the Federation of American Scientists’ Nuclear Information Project.
![Russia's Tsar Bomb, the most powerful nuclear weapon ever created, is on display ](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/667f629bd68cca1336ff8232/Russia-s-Tsar-Bomb--the-most-powerful-nuclear-weapon-ever-created--is-on-display/960x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=144)

Russia currently holds “approximately 34 SS-18s that can carry up to 340 warheads,” they reveal in a report, “,” released by the _Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists_ , a publication founded by Albert Einstein as part of his movement aimed at preventing an atomic apocalypse via worldwide nuclear disarmament.
The SS-18, “which the United States and NATO designated ‘Satan’ - presumably to reflect its extraordinary destructive capability,” is due to be replaced in Russia’s ongoing nuclear modernization drive with the Sarmat, or SS-29, an even more powerful ICBM, the experts at the Federation of American Scientists say.
The Sarmat missile, now being tested, “could theoretically carry up to 14 warheads in two tiers of seven warheads each,” they add.
If an American space-based interceptor fails to hit an SS-18 during its boost phase, the U.S. would have to fire 10 ground-based interceptors to destroy - on separate trajectories - as they descended during their intercontinental flight.
So the strategic advantage of halting the ICBMs right after their liftoff with the orbiting interceptors is overwhelming.
Just eight days after he regained the keys to the White House, President Donald Trump ordered the Department of Defense to rapidly blueprint the construction of in low Earth orbit, capable of lightning-speed boost-phase strikes, to protect the nation from a nuclear missile barrage - “the most catastrophic threat facing the United States.”

Todd Harrison, who holds an advanced degree in aeronautics and astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says he updated a breakthrough study on alternative missile defense systems conducted by the American Physical Society back in 2004. The APS convened a group of elite U.S. “physicists and engineers, including individuals with experience in sensors, missiles, rocket interceptors, guidance and control, high-powered lasers, and missile-defense-related systems, to assess the .”
“With the technology we judge could become available within the next 15 years,” the APS physicists predicted, “defending against a single ICBM would require a thousand or more interceptors.”
“Deploying such a system would require at least a five- to tenfold increase over current U.S. space-launch rates.”
The that’s played out since then has provided skyrocketing U.S. space-launch rates, says Harrison, along with diving launch prices that could enable an expanding net of interceptors to be lofted.
Harrison says the 1900-interceptor model he tested has to be immensely scaled up to take out Russia’s entire chessboard of nuclear-armed ICBMs.
Due to its limited size, the prototype shield he modeled could only hit two ICMBs launched simultaneously from the same silo base. If four intercontinental missiles were lofted in a salvo, he adds, two could penetrate this minimal shield and reach their American targets.
Because the effectiveness of the shield scales linearly, he explains, its size would have to be doubled - to 3800 interceptors - to be able to take down four nuclear missiles launched in a cluster.
Yet the size of the Kremlin’s ICBM armada is many times larger, say the worldwide nuclear weapons monitors at the Federation of American Scientists.
“Russia’s Strategic Rocket Force currently deploys several variants of silo-based and mobile ICBMs,” they say in their report on Russia’s atomic arsenal.
Based on information gleaned from cutting-edge imagery satellites that scan Russian ICBM silos, and from data exchanges between Moscow and Washington required under the on nuclear arms limitations, they say, “We estimate that Russia may have approximately 326 nuclear-armed ICBMs, which we estimate can carry up to 1,246 warheads.”
If American defense strategists combine Russia’s 320-plus ICBMs with North Korea’s estimated 50-plus nuclear warheads, following the Cold War confederates’ signing of a new mutual defense pact in mid-2024, then the U.S. could design a shield to repel at least 400 ICBMs - to counter a synchronized launch by the aligned rogue powers.
The Earth-orbiting shield would have to be expanded to include 200,000 interceptors to ensure 400 ballistic missiles - launched simultaneously across Russia and North Korea - could all be struck down before releasing their civilization-crushing warheads, Harrison says.
SpaceX has led the revolution in low-cost rocketry, and its , when perfected, is likely to provide the most economical means to lift the American interceptors into orbit, Harrison says.
Blue Origin’s just-debuted , could begin launching components of the shield this year, in line with the rapid-fire timetable suggested in President Trump’s call for “The Iron Dome for America” to be constructed at super-speeds.

Building and lofting a constellation of 200,000 space-based interceptors - with the potential to protect the entire United States, and the world - from a Kremlin-launched nuclear Armageddon, Harrison tells me, “would cost between $370 billion and $1.2 trillion.”
Although these figures seem rather high, the Federation of American Scientists predicted in a separate report, issued in May of 2024, that: “The United States has embarked on a wide-ranging nuclear modernization program that will ultimately see every nuclear delivery system replaced with newer versions over the coming decades.”
“The total cost of ,” the Federation of American Scientists added. “Calls to increase the nuclear arsenal would increase cost further and compete with non-nuclear defense needs.”
That means that replacing the American nuclear modernization campaign with the war-stopping celestial missile shield, as part of a planet-wide nuclear disarmament agreement, could actually save the U.S. half a trillion dollars or more, and would dovetail with President Trump’s revelation in January that he aims to push for steep cuts in the nuclear weapons stockpiles created across the northern hemisphere.
“Tremendous amounts of money are being spent on nuclear, and the destructive capability is something that we don’t even want to talk about today, because you don’t want to hear it - it’s too depressing,” Trump declared during his first week back in the Oval Office. “So, we want to , and I think that’s very possible.”
Space defense scholar Todd Harrison says the White House’s highlighting its strategy to assemble the world’s first space-based missile shield during the dawn of the new presidency might also be a way of bringing Russia to the negotiating table.
President Trump has signaled he is considering freezing the Pentagon’s nuclear modernization drive.
", we already have so many," Fox News quoted President Trump as saying at the White House. "You could destroy the world 50 times over, 100 times over. And here we are building new nuclear weapons, and they’re building nuclear weapons.”
"We’re all spending a lot of money that we could be spending on other things that are actually, hopefully, much more productive.”

NASA is critical to national security. China intends to lead the world in space, and if that’s not a concern to you, it should be: The United States can boost its position by reinvigorating NASA as part of a three-tiered effort to win the 21st century space race.
Over the past two decades, China has demonstrated a direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon, littering space with more than 3,000 pieces of the dead satellite it used for target practice; deployed laser weapons in tests against U.S. spacecraft, deployed a satellite with a robotic arm that can grapple rival satellites, and maneuvered its spacecraft to test U.S. responses. China has also visited the dark side of the Moon, a key first step to potential territorial claims there—and, potentially, beyond.
As Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) aptly at a recent congressional hearing: “One of my greatest concerns is that NASA astronauts will arrive at the Moon only to be greeted by a sign that says, ‘No Trespassers’—in Mandarin.”
PROMOTED
Fundamental Space Sectors
The U.S. earned its lead global position in space through a combination of military, commercial, and civil space activities. All three sectors embrace an over-arching U.S. belief that space should remain open and accessible to all nations. America welcomes Chinese space activity; yet our national leaders rightfully view China’s behavior in space as dangerous. Countering China in space will therefore require a unified response that bridges all three sectors of U.S. space activity.
Since its birth in 2019, the has worked to counter China’s threatening activity. Under Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman, the Space Force has defined a highly effective strategy; corresponding operational concepts and technologies; and a new training regimen to ensure U.S. equities in space are secured. The Space Force is on the right track.
MORE FOR YOU
The U.S. commercial space industry is likewise accelerating its contributions. New entrants are joining traditional aerospace giants to field new capabilities with greater capacity and faster performance than ever before. Case in point: This month, for the first time in decades, an American spacecraft landed on the Moon. Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost lander touched down March 2, the first commercial spacecraft to land on the Moon in history. Upon landing it began a two-week science mission for NASA.
Firefly’s landing is an incredible achievement, one that would have been inconceivable just a decade ago. What made it possible was the strength of the U.S. commercial space industrial base, which is redefining daily the art of the possible as people and organizations are incentivized to innovate and are freed from the constraints in place if in government.
The third component of America’s spacepower triad is the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Once the penultimate disruptive actor during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs of the 1960s and 1970s, NASA lost some of its mystique over the past quarter century, as the once daring agency became bogged down by bureaucracy, budget cuts, and erosion of its traditional derring-do.
America’s original journey to the Moon and back was an incredible national achievement, signifying both undeniable technical superiority and the power of the American system to achieve even the most audacious of goals.
Today, 55 years after Neil Armstrong took that first “giant leap for mankind,” NASA must return to those foundational principles.
NASA’s budget of roughly $25 billion amounts to less than half of 1 percent of the federal budget—less even than the U.S. Space Force. Risk-averse leadership dynamics have come to dominate its culture, and cost overruns and inefficiencies further dilute the impact of its limited funds.
By contrast, in the Apollo years, when NASA was leading America’s foray into space, its budget reached —eight times, proportionally, our national investment today.
Meanwhile, China is doubling down on its space investment and accelerating its lunar ambitions. Not only has China landed on the far side of the Moon, it has also established communications capability there and is planning to establish a permanent lunar base by 2030. In other words, China is ahead in its 21st century space race with the U.S.
America must respond with robust action and corresponding investment. The Trump administration has committed to sending Americans to Mars, but it will take more than words to achieve that and related objectives. American can only win this new space race with strong leadership and a budget to match.
Leadership
President Trump has already made the right move with respect to leadership. NASA needs a bold, results-driven leader, experienced in developing space technology and able to inspire change, disrupt stagnation, and hold people accountable. That is exactly what the president’s choice, Mr. Jared Isaacman, brings to the fore.
Mr. Isaacman is a visionary leader with strong business acumen who founded —a payment processing company—and built it into a multibillion international operation. Later, he founded , one of the first large-scale private companies providing adversary air support to U.S. military services, a challenging and risky business that gave him invaluable insight into government contracting, risk mitigation, and more. A trained pilot himself, he has also flown in space—twice.
Having led the first all-private crew into orbit in space on Inspiration4 and later commanded the Polaris Dawn mission, performing the first civilian spacewalk, Mr. Isaacman is uniquely qualified to ensure U.S. preeminence in space.
Most important, he understands that NASA’s success is fundamentally intertwined with America’s national security.
If confirmed as the new NASA Administrator—and there is no reason to think he will not—Mr. Isaacman should view his new charge through three primary lenses: technical advancement, industrial and international partnership, and renewed international prestige.
Winning the 21st Century Space Race
First, America’s space accomplishments fundamentally depend on demonstrated results. That demands aggressive, consistent technological progress. NASA’s recent activities have moved it forward in some areas—like the 2021 double asteroid redirection test mission—but more should be expected of our national space agency. The record over the years is too often one of delays and setbacks, whether that involves launch vehicles, crew capsules, or even returning astronauts from space. To chart a return to the moon and beyond, America needs to see progress and a clear demand for excellence.
Funding is a crucial element here, but no more than leadership. Isaacman’s record as a business leader and private astronaut shows he has the skillset to reestablish at NASA a culture defined by bold initiative and accountability.
Second, NASA must seek to foster and empower partnerships with both commercial industry and aligned nations. The commercial lunar payload services (CLPS) program is a clear example of positive collaboration, as is the creation and expansion of the , now supported by 53 nations committed to peaceful exploration of space, is another positive example. In both cases, technical accomplishments and international teaming are yielding results far greater than what a single actor could achieve alone. This is crucial given China’s resources and determination.
Finally, with technical advancements and partnerships moving forward, the American people should enjoy robust prestige and pride regarding their nation’s advancements in space. The image of the U.S. flag on the moon—an indelible icon since 1969—remains a marker for all mankind.
We must return to that results-oriented ethos, which stands in stark contrast to the years when U.S. astronauts were relegated to relying on Russian boosters to get them into orbit.
New markers in the race include U.S. astronauts returning to the Moon and the nation’s ambitious objective to land on Mars. Yet many Presidents have talked about this goal without making the investment to deliver that outcome. Now is the time to commit.
As China strives to dominate space, only the United States can pose a credible challenge. Either America leads this journey, setting the norms and standards for the rest of the world, or China will lead, choosing rules that support its own jingoistic aims.
We have already seen what Chinese domination looks like on Earth. We’ve seen it in Hong Kong and in international waters near the Philippines and Vietnam. We can expect the same kind of aggressive approach in space.
Re-establishing NASA as a powerful civilian technological leader is a necessary step to securing America’s strategic, economic, and technological future. NASA is critical to national security. If America cedes its primacy in space, it risks losing its competitive edge on Earth. As Gene Krantz, the father of the Apollo space program once declared, “Failure is not an option.”

 _This report is from this week's CNBC's "Inside India" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. Like what you see? You can subscribe_
## The big story
India is already the world's top weapons importer but that's not stopping the country from strengthening its defense capabilities. New Delhi plans to spend about $200 billion over the on transforming and modernizing its military.
This raises an important question: Why is India in a hurry to double down on weaponry and fighter jets? You would think it's Pakistan, the country's neighbor and longtime rival. However, foreign policy analysts say the trigger is to the east of India — specifically, China. 
Heightened geopolitical tensions, skirmishes at the India-China border and Beijing's elevated presence in the Indian Ocean have contributed to India's quest to beef up its defense. India and China are also locked in a technology rivalry that experts say has contributed to growing tensions between the two rising Asian nations.
"China's expansionist policies and military buildup along the border remain a serious challenge," Pravin Krishna, professor of international economics at Johns Hopkins University, told CNBC.
Beijing's elevated presence around the subcontinent's waters is the most pressing concern.
"China has made the point that the Indian Ocean is not India's ocean," Pramit Pal Chaudhuri, Eurasia Group's South Asia practice head, told CNBC on the phone.
Chaudhari added that according to Indian navy intelligence, China is building aircraft carriers, two of which will be deployed in the Indian Ocean. Beijing also has a full naval base in Djibouti, a country on the east of the African continent, where it conducts navy drills from.
### **Renewed U.S.-India relations**
Against this backdrop, India Prime Minister Narendra Modi met U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House where the two leaders confirmed efforts to strengthen U.S.-India defense ties.
Modi also signed India up to , including additional heavy armored vehicles, drones and fighter jets.
"It is extraordinary that, less than one month into the new Trump Administration, the United States and India could announce such a broad set of actions in the defense sector," former U.S. Ambassador to India Kenneth I. Juster told CNBC in an email.
Procuring U.S. defense equipment is also one way New Delhi can lower the growing U.S.-India trade deficit, seen as key to maintaining good relations with Trump.
has captured the largest portion of U.S. foreign military sales to India since 2017, according to estimates by Cowen Washington Research Group, a research arm at the investment bank TD Cowen. Trump also India access to Lockheed Martin's state-of-the-art supersonic Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets.
India is not technically eligible for the F-35s given that the country is not a formal military ally of the U.S. and is currently a buyer of Russian equipment.
If Trump does make an exception, analysts say that would be a big win for India, though others are hard-pressed to see this happen. According to Reuters, India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri that the U.S. offer to sell F-35s was at a "proposal stage", adding that the acquisition process had not started.
"We believe there will be some challenges completing the sale given India's use of Russian military systems," Roman Schweizer, aerospace and defense policy analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group, told CNBC over email.
### **Playing catch-up with China**
Irrespective of the outcome of the F-35 deal, India's defense spending is expected to remain robust. Overall, estimates India's capital expenditures on defense will grow by 8% every year from 2024 to 2026.
"Growth in India's defense capex is driven by its own geopolitical and security considerations," Atul Tiwari, infrastructure, industrials and utilities analyst at JPMorgan, wrote to clients in a note on Monday.
However, experts argue that India still has a long way to go in playing catch-up with its main rival, China. By official numbers, China's military and defense budget is currently three times the size of India's and growing at a fast rate, according to Eurasia.
Capacity limitations in the U.S. could also complicate India's plans to double down on U.S. defense equipment.
"Limited investment in manufacturing … means the U.S. defense industrial base faces capacity constraints and extended delivery timelines.
