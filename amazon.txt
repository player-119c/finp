Shares of plunged more than 30% on Wednesday after there is "substantial doubt" about its ability to stay in business.
The Roomba maker's financial outlook has darkened since abandoned its of the company , citing regulatory scrutiny. Since then, iRobot has struggled to generate cash and pay off debts.
Massachusetts-based iRobot has been restructuring since the Amazon deal plunged into uncertainty. The company has laid off 51% of its workforce since the end of 2023, and iRobot has looked to reignite revenue growth by overhauling its product lineup. The company on Tuesday eight new Roombas in the hopes of "better positioning iRobot as the leader in the category that we created," CEO Gary Cohen said in a statement.
"There can be no assurance that the new product launches will be successful," iRobot said in its Wednesday earnings statement, citing limited consumer demand, tariff uncertainty and heightened competition.
"Given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months," iRobot said in its earnings report.
The company's fourth-quarter revenue sagged 44% year over year to $172 million, missing estimates of $180.8 million, according to FactSet. The Roomba maker posted a net loss of $77.1 million, or $2.52 per share. Excluding a one-time "manufacturing transition charge," iRobot had a loss of $2.06 a share, exceeding the $1.73 per share projected by analysts surveyed by FactSet.
In July 2023, iRobot took a $200 million loan from the to fund the company's operations as a stopgap until the Amazon deal closed. The company amended the loan for a temporary waiver on certain financial obligations, which requires iRobot to pay a fee of $3.6 million.
As part of Wednesday's report, iRobot said its board has initiated a strategic review of the business and is considering alternatives that could include refinancing its debt and exploring a potential sale. The board hasn't set a deadline for when its review will conclude, the company said.
Shortly after the Amazon deal fell apart, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy approach to its iRobot acquisition. European Union regulators , and the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. to challenge the acquisition in court.
The proposed merger, which was announced in late 2022, would have allowed iRobot to scale and better compete with its rivals, Jassy said. Several of the fastest-growing robotic vacuum businesses are based in China, such as Anker, Ecovacs and Roborock, all of which have eaten into iRobot's share of the market.
"We abdicate the acquisition, iRobot lays off a third of its staff, the stock price completely tanks, and now, there's a real question of whether they're going to be a going concern," Jassy told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin in an interview last April.

### Hard-hit stocks catch another bid — plus, how our sell-off strategy has paid off so far

Every weekday, the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer releases the Homestretch — an actionable afternoon update, just in time for the last hour of trading on Wall Street. Markets: Stocks are nicely higher Wednesday thanks to deeply oversold conditions and some good news on the inflation front. The consumer price index report for February came in slightly cooler than expectations, rising 2.8% year over year. Although the Federal Reserve is unlikely to adjust policy at its upcoming meetings in March and May, the latest data has the market feeling better about inflation, and expectations of a possible cut in June are starting to grow. For the second session in a row, some of the most beaten-down tech stocks are bouncing the strongest. Nvidia , CrowdStrike and Broadcom are some of the biggest gainers in the portfolio. Our financials also are bouncing, led by Capital One , our newest stock. We took a stake last Thursday and made additional buys on Friday, Monday and Tuesday. Dented defensives : On the other hand, the bloom has come off the rose for those defensive, non-economically sensitive stocks that were bid up way too aggressively over the past week such as Procter & Gamble . Including Wednesday's move, shares of P & G are down roughly 4% over the past two days. Consumer staples are by far the worst-performing sector in Wednesday's session, followed by health care. We have been pointing out that these rallies were unsustainable, which is why we've booked profits in Bristol Myers Squibb , Abbott Laboratories (twice), Linde and GE Healthcare into relative strength. The rotation could flip back if tariff talks get more aggressive or if there's sluggish economic data. But those sales helped us replenish our cash position and maintain our flexibility as we made opportunistic buys across tech, financials, and discretionary-based stocks. In addition to the those aforementioned Capital One buys, we've picked up more shares of CrowdStrike, Goldman Sachs , Disney , TJX Companies and Texas Roadhouse so far this week. Tech talk: Headlines involving two of our tech giants caught our attention this afternoon. First, the Federal Trade Commission asked a judge to delay a case against Amazon over alleged deceptive practices involving Prime due to budget and staffing shortfalls (After the close Wednesday, the FTC lawyer said he misspoke and the agency "does not have resource constraints" and is "fully prepared to litigate this case.") Meanwhile, Alphabet's Google announced a pair of AI models focused on robotics. The field, sometimes called physical AI, is an increasing area of focus for many tech companies, including Nvidia. We expect to hear Nvidia talk about its long-term opportunity in physical AI next week at its hotly anticipated GTC conference. Up next: No companies in the portfolio are scheduled to report. After the closing bell Wednesday we'll see earnings from Adobe , SentinelOne , Crown Castle and American Eagle . The only notable company reporting before the opening bell Thursday is Dollar General . On the economic data side, we'll be looking to see if the wholesale inflation report — known as the producer price index — comes in cool like the CPI report. Also, the weekly look at initial jobless claims will be released. Mark your calendars: Our Monthly Meeting for March will kick off at noon ET on Thursday.

The sky is not falling for Club name Eaton — even if the chart this year for the electrical equipment supplier suggests otherwise. The news KeyBanc upgraded Eaton to its buy-equivalent overweight rating after the company's investor day Tuesday afternoon. The analysts said the stock's recent pullback has created a "unique entry point into one of our highest-quality names." Their price target of $340 a share implies about 20% upside from where shares closed Tuesday. However, that level is still $31 below its highest close of the year on Jan. 22, which was just days before the emergence of Chinese startup DeepSeek sparked a wave of concerns about artificial intelligence investments. Shares of Eaton, whose fast-growing data center business benefits from that spending, tumbled in response. KeyBanc believes Eaton's actual business is in fine shape, though, and the analysts said the company's "robust" project backlogs in its electrical and aerospace segments "provide greater visibility in an increasingly uncertain certain world." Even with AI spending fears still lingering, the analysts said they were encouraged by Eaton management noting that only 20% of its electrical backlog in its North and South American segment is tied to AI. That gives KeyBanc confidence that Eaton's data center business can sustain growth in the high-teens percentages. More generally, KeyBanc liked the long-term growth targets outlined at Tuesday's investor event. Eaton projected 6% to 9% organic growth through 2030, compared with the 5% to 8% target previously offered for the 2020 to 2025 period. Elsewhere, Jefferies lowered its price target on Wednesday to $335 a share, down from $390, but kept its buy target on the stock. At its investor day, Eaton projected its segment operating margin to be around 28% in 2030, up from 24% in 2024 and 17.3% in 2019. Jefferies analysts said, "Guidance felt conservative relative to segment forecasts, with additional upside potential from capital deployment." Shares of Eaton rose more than 3% on Wednesday, outperforming both the S & P 500, which advanced modestly and the industrials sector, which was roughly flat. Big picture Eaton's stock hasn't been able to catch a break since the Jan. 27 DeepSeek panic roiled the AI trade — even though just a few days later the company reported earnings , and executives made clear they remained confident in the outlook for its data center business.

ETN YTD mountain Eaton YTD Still, the AI trade hasn't been able to recapture the momentum it had in 2023 and 2024, years in which Eaton soared 53% and 38%, respectively. Eaton is one of the portfolio's worst-performing stocks in 2025. Other stocks near the bottom of us include AI chipmakers Nvidia and Broadcom , as well as Salesforce , which has bet big on AI software tools. Emerging worries about the health of the U.S. economy in recent weeks also haven't helped shares of industrial companies such as Eaton. The sector is seen as economically sensitive, and money has been flowing into more defensive corners of the market such as consumer staples.

"This is a total overreaction," Jim Cramer said on Wednesday's Morning Meeting , as he pointed to Eaton's stock performance since late January. "Total overreaction." We bought the dip on Feb. 21, adding 25 shares at roughly $296 apiece, and Jim suggested others follow suit. "It's time to buy some Eaton if you haven't bought any Eaton," he added. While our confidence in Eaton hadn't been shaken, the company's investor day was nevertheless a positive development. Eaton's organic growth forecast through 2030, in particular, is "very strong for an industrial," Jim said. Eaton also expects additional margin expansion in the years ahead — a good sign for earnings growth. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long ETN. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

Retail has undergone a rapid transformation in recent years. Customer expectations are changing rapidly, and businesses that adopt unified commerce can meet these expectations. But the real revolution is yet to come: Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to take unified commerce to an entirely new level.
From personalized recommendations and automated inventory management to AI-powered customer service, AI is reshaping how businesses interact with their customers.
As someone who has been deeply involved in digital transformation projects within the retail sector, I have witnessed firsthand the shift toward unified commerce. At my company, we have helped businesses integrate AI-driven solutions to enhance customer engagement and optimize operations. This experience has fueled my passion for exploring how AI will further redefine the retail landscape.
PROMOTED
In this article, we explore unified commerce, the role of AI and the future of retail.
## What Is Unified Commerce?
Unified commerce goes beyond omnichannel. While omnichannel strategies focus on linking various sales channels, unified commerce integrates all channels into a single platform. This means:
• Customers experience the same shopping journey, whether browsing online, using an app or visiting a store.
• Data from all channels is synchronized in real time, providing businesses with better insights into customer behavior and inventory.
• The customer journey becomes frictionless, allowing smooth transitions between channels without interruptions.
## The Role Of AI In Unified Commerce
AI is the key to making unified commerce more efficient, intelligent and personalized. Businesses that leverage AI benefit in multiple ways:
### 1. Hyper-Personalization In Real Time
Modern consumers expect tailor-made experiences. AI analyzes user behavior and preferences in real time to generate individualized offers, including:
• Personalized product recommendations based on past purchases and interests.
• Dynamic pricing that adapts to demand and customer profiles.
• Customized marketing campaigns tailored to each customer’s needs.
### 2. AI-Powered Chatbots And Voice Assistants
Customer service is a crucial factor in retail success. AI-driven chatbots and voice assistants significantly improve customer communication with the following:
• 24/7 support without waiting times.
• Smart assistants that answer product inquiries and process orders.
• Voice-activated shopping experiences integrated with smart devices.
### 3. Predictive Analytics For Better Decision-Making
By leveraging AI, organizations can process data to generate predictions along the following lines:
• Which products will be in high demand in the coming weeks?
• Which items should be stocked in which stores?
• Which customers are ready for an upsell offer?
AI helps businesses make informed decisions and maximize revenue opportunities.
### 4. Automated Inventory And Supply Chain Management
One of the biggest challenges in retail is inventory optimization. AI helps manage stock efficiently by doing the following:
• Automatic reordering of products before they run out.
• Reduction of storage costs through optimized demand forecasting.
• Prevention of stock shortages and overproduction.
### 5. Dynamic Pricing And AI-Driven Price Optimization
In a competitive market, dynamic pricing is essential. AI analyzes the following in real time, allowing businesses to adjust accordingly:
• Shifts in demand and market trends.
• Competitor prices and customer behavior.
• Seasonal influences and individual purchase histories.
## Real-World Examples: AI In Action
Some leading companies are already successfully leveraging AI in unified commerce, including the following:
• uses machine learning to provide customers with personalized product recommendations.
• employs AI to reduce returns by offering customers precise size recommendations.
• integrates chatbots and AR technology to deliver personalized makeup suggestions.
These examples demonstrate that AI is not just a trend—it is fundamentally transforming how businesses operate.
## Challenges And Risks
Despite the many advantages, there are also challenges:
**• Data Privacy And Security:** Customers must trust that their data is protected.
**• Technological Complexity:** Implementing AI requires expertise and investment.
**• Customer Acceptance:** Not all customers feel comfortable with AI-driven interactions.
At my company, we have encountered these challenges while working with retailers on AI implementations. A key takeaway from our experience is that transparency and customer education are essential. Businesses must clearly communicate how AI enhances the shopping experience while ensuring robust data protection measures.
To champion privacy at your company, follow industry best practices to safeguard customer data, including end-to-end encryption, anonymization techniques and strict access controls. Advocate for privacy-by-design principles, ensuring compliance with GDPR and other regulations from the outset. You can also leverage explainable AI (XAI) frameworks, allowing customers to understand how their data is used while maintaining full control over their preferences.
## The Future Of Retail With AI And Unified Commerce
I believe the combination of unified commerce and artificial intelligence will fundamentally reshape retail in the coming years. Customers increasingly expect personalized, seamless and intelligent shopping experiences—AI makes this possible.
Companies that invest in AI technologies early on may not only gain a competitive advantage, but they may also actively shape the future of retail. Unified commerce is no longer the future—it is the present. But with AI, it could become truly revolutionary.

Your money never sleeps. Before the world wakes, artificial intelligence (AI) driven systems are already scanning markets, seizing opportunities, and securing profits. This isn’t the future—it’s happening now.
AI and blockchain—the twin engines of autonomous finance—aren’t just digitizing money; they’re rewiring finance itself. Blockchain is the trust engine, enforcing transparency and enabling atomic settlement—no middlemen required. AI is the intelligence engine, continuously learning, predicting, and executing trades in real time through autonomous agents.
These agents optimize capital flows with unmatched speed, but their rapid evolution introduces structural risks—algorithmic instability, security vulnerabilities, regulatory blind spots, and the potential for cascading failures if safeguards aren’t in place. Retail investors now tap into hedge-fund-grade strategies—but they’re also vulnerable to flash crashes that can erase savings in an instant.
PROMOTED
The result? A financial system that never stops learning, adapting, and executing—reacting to market shifts at speeds no human can match.
Finance's power dynamics are shifting as Wall Street titans and nimble disruptors leverage these technologies to gain an edge. Institutional investors deploy algorithms that execute optimum trades, while tech-first banks dramatically cut operational costs. Traditional wealth managers accustomed to relationship-driven finance must now adapt to a world where algorithms make split-second decisions.
**Trillion-Dollar Upheaval**
The financial services market is staggering: in asset management, in global payments, $200 trillion in banking, and in repo markets daily. AI is surging toward , crypto is cementing its $2 trillion foothold, and is set to unlock $16 trillion in liquid assets by 2030.
MORE FOR YOU
At this scale, efficiency gains—such as instant settlements and the removal of intermediaries—don’t just cut costs. They create new profit centers for incumbents and unlock high-value opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs, reshaping the financial landscape.
For centuries, financial power was concentrated in the hands of a few—banks with rigid hours, brokers with steep fees, and investment firms with high barriers to entry. That dominance is fading. AI and blockchain aren’t just making finance faster; they’re making it accessible. Hedge fund-grade strategies, real-time insights, and automated portfolio management are no longer reserved for institutions. From fraud detection to high-speed execution, intelligent systems eliminate inefficiencies and redefine financial participation. The gates are no longer locked—anyone with an internet connection can enter.
**Industry Giants Are Paying Attention**
Traditional finance (TradFI) sees the shift—AI and blockchain are no longer experimental; they’re becoming the backbone of financial infrastructure. But adoption isn't instant. Financial institutions, entrenched in compliance and legacy systems, must tread carefully—yet they aren't sitting idle. They recognize the potential and are actively integrating AI's paradigm-shifting capabilities **in** advanced analytics and dramatic operational efficiency gains while methodically exploring blockchain for settlement and tokenization.
Meanwhile, Silicon Valley's tech titans—Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google, OpenAI, and Nvidia—are unleashing powerful AI innovations, building the infrastructure they believe will underpin entire industries, finance included. With total investments approaching the mark, these tech giants are betting big on AI's transformative potential across the entire economy.
BlackRock, managing a jaw-dropping , sent shockwaves through Wall Street by launching its first . Suddenly, blockchain wasn't just for crypto diehards—it was institutional finance's next big move. Fidelity and Schwab are building institutional crypto custody and trading services. Meanwhile, crypto's early disruptors like and have evolved into AI-powered financial powerhouses, integrating real-time fraud detection and high-speed execution that outpaces legacy markets.
**The Living Market: Finance's New Nervous System & Digital Workforce**
Together, AI and blockchain create an ecosystem where automation isn't just about speed but about trust, security, and predictive intelligence. A new financial nervous system is emerging—one that doesn't just automate but actively thinks, learns, and adapts. This evolving network integrates security, adaptability, and intelligence seamlessly. Blockchain serves as the backbone, while AI functions as the cognitive layer—transforming static rules into dynamic learning. This isn't just a faster version of today's financial systems; it's an entirely new species.
Traditional finance relies on centralized controls and human intervention. This new ecosystem makes autonomous decisions, self-corrects vulnerabilities, and optimizes in real-time. The implications extend beyond efficiency—we're entering an era where capital moves with real-time intelligence, reacting instantly to opportunities and risks.
This shift isn't about 24/7 markets—it's about superhuman markets. AI-driven trading reads millions of signals at once, hedges risks in milliseconds, and fine-tunes strategies faster than any human trader could dream of.

**The AI-Blockchain Nexus: Reshaping Financial Infrastructure**
The convergence of AI and blockchain isn’t just an incremental upgrade—it’s a fundamental shift in finance. At their intersection, these technologies unlock capabilities neither could achieve alone, reshaping trading, payments, security, and infrastructure.
**Trading & Investment Platforms** use machine learning to detect fraud in microseconds while analyzing complex market patterns beyond human capability. is expanding institutional-grade custodial and trading services, while ’s blockchain-backed ETFs offer mainstream investors a gateway to digital assets. , an AI-powered trading platform, launched SSI on Base Chain, enabling users to hold algorithmically rebalanced crypto baskets, like on-chain ETFs. With 30M registered users and 1M DAUs in 2024, it hit $200M TVL within weeks of staking launch. Its top index tokens, MAG7.ssi and USSI (hedged MAG7.ssi for funding rate earning), rank among Uniswap Base’s top 5 liquidity pools.
**Payment & Settlement Systems** AI-driven fraud detection and transaction optimization are transforming payments. systems have cut fraud rates by 30% while processing over $1.5 trillion annually—all without customers noticing. enhances payment routing with machine learning, reducing costs for merchants. is piloting AI-powered cross-border settlements, while AI-enhanced payment systems analyze transactions in real-time, improving security and slashing settlement times.

Security measures include multi-user approval protocols, cold storage for 96% of funds, and advanced encryption for private keys. CER.live includes it among its top five exchanges for security. Through institutional partnerships and its Barcelona sponsorship, WhiteBIT continues advancing mainstream crypto adoption.
**Infrastructure & Development** is deploying AI-driven analytics to optimize blockchain-based settlements, while is exploring AI applications in . and are developing AI-enhanced smart contract infrastructure to improve governance efficiency and scalability in decentralized ecosystems. Meanwhile, is embedding AI into compliance systems, simplifying regulatory processes for digital assets. AI pioneers Real-World AI (RWAI), enabling users to create AI-DIDs and train autonomous AI Agents for on-chain economies. These agents, guided by goals, KPIs, and tokenized incentives, drive real economic activity while ensuring transparency and accountability. By merging AI with blockchain’s decentralized coordination, ForU AI is redefining automation—empowering communities to govern, build, and optimize shared financial and social ecosystems.
The shift from human-managed finance to AI-powered financial ecosystems is no longer theoretical—it's already in motion. The future of finance isn’t just about speed—it’s about autonomy, adaptability, and continuous evolution.
**The AI-Blockchain Dilemma: Hype Meets Hard Reality**
AI and blockchain are rewriting finance, but they come with real risks.
Regulators struggle to keep up with borderless AI-driven markets, where oversight gaps can allow hidden risks to pile up. Algorithmic volatility is another wild card—just look at the 2010 Flash Crash when high-frequency trading erased nearly $1 trillion in minutes. Regulators worldwide, from the SEC to the European Commission, are actively assessing how to oversee AI-driven markets, but no global framework yet exists.
And while blockchain promises decentralization, AI’s massive computing demands could shift power to those with the biggest infrastructure, reinforcing financial gatekeeping instead of breaking it.
The biggest unknown? Financial stability. Traditional markets have circuit breakers and central banks to stop crises from spiraling out of control—but in AI-powered, blockchain-driven finance, who steps in when things go wrong?
These challenges aren’t theoretical—they’re already shaping global regulatory debates. The future of AI-driven finance depends on how we balance innovation and control.
**Your Place in the Financial Revolution**
Finance is at an inflection point, undergoing an infrastructure overhaul with profound, far-reaching effects. For centuries, financial expertise has been locked behind exclusive credentials and privileged access. AI and blockchain are dismantling these walls, making advanced financial tools available to everyone. Make no mistake: this isn't some distant future to contemplate—it's a financial tsunami already reshaping the shore. Finance is diverging: the old system, built for a slower, human-driven market, and the new frontier—optimized for instant, AI-powered decision-making.
As you read this, billions are flowing through AI-driven systems—relentless, autonomous, and unstoppable. The tide is shifting. Ride the wave, or get left behind.

As attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) intensify— including banning its presence in K-12 schools and institutions of higher education—it is imperative to reflect on the failures of DEI’s rollout and build a path forward that protects the gains of the past decade, and build towards stronger, more equitable workplaces.
There’s a sense that companies are obeying in advance, even when DEI efforts are legally defensible. In response to higher education institutions removing any mention of DEI from their website, the Georgetown University Law Center professor and the former National Legal Director of the ACLU David Cole writes, “Yet not a single one of these changes was necessary. This is self-censorship. It’s what Trump wants—but it’s not what either his executive order or federal law requires.”
Cole and other legal scholars made it clear that despite the current administration’s best placed efforts, the path forward is clear and legally defensible.
## DEI has become nearly synonymous with anti-racism training.
In the past decade, organizations eager to demonstrate commitment have prioritized training sessions over systemic interventions, despite mounting evidence that these programs frequently backfire. Authors Frank Dobbin and Alexandra Kalev reviewed nearly a and found that, “The positive effects of diversity training rarely last beyond a day or two, and a number of studies suggest that it can activate bias or spark a backlash.”
PROMOTED
Mandatory anti-racism training can increase resistance, deepen workplace tensions, and ultimately make life more difficult for people of color and other marginalized communities.
Yet, DEI practitioners continued to push these trainings—akin to placing curtains over a condemned house—rather than advocating for structural change. Years ago, when concerns were raised about the long-term damage of such programs, they were dismissed. The result? Short-term solutions prevailed, and systemic issues remained unaddressed.
In my first piece in , I reflected on the financial impact of refusing to supply solutions that did not work, and the importance of building longer term, sustainable and evidence backed strategies.
MORE FOR YOU
By avoiding the heavy lifting of real institutional reform, DEI initiatives have inadvertently fueled opposition, enabling right-wing politicians to exploit these missteps to justify rolling back civil rights protections.
## The Absence of Data
One of DEI’s biggest blind spots is its frequent disregard for data. Too often, HR and DEI practitioners enter the field motivated by a passion for people rather than an understanding of numbers. This aversion to data has led to poorly designed strategies based on anecdotal evidence from a handful of engaged employees rather than robust analytics.
notes, “An alarming majority are unprepared to address systemic inequities effectively, as few have a culture of measuring their current state of DEI programs and culture. Without an accurate diagnosis, organizations are ill-equipped to design and implement a comprehensive equity strategy.”
Anecdotes and surface-level sentiments are insufficient to drive meaningful change. Organizations must embrace a data-driven approach, leveraging quantitative and qualitative insights to shape policies that yield measurable progress. Without this shift, DEI will continue to be a feel-good exercise rather than a tool for real transformation.
## A Lack of Class Consciousness
DEI initiatives have disproportionately benefited an upwardly mobile, professional class while neglecting the vast majority of workers, particularly those in frontline, blue-collar, and low-income professions.
This imbalance is stark. Consider Amazon: a company that employs dozens in DEI roles while overseeing a workforce of over a million people living on the . Despite America’s workforce being incredibly diverse at the lower rungs, leadership and boardrooms remain largely unchanged—predominantly white and male.
Similarly, the nonprofit and public sectors have perpetuated these disparities. Despite their commitments to equity, many DEI programs in these sectors fail to address wage gaps, job security, and career mobility for frontline and entry level workers. There is little effort to provide upskilling opportunities, childcare support, or workplace protections—critical factors that would genuinely improve economic mobility for marginalized groups.
The reality is that DEI has functioned as a privilege multiplier, benefiting those already in relatively secure professional roles while leaving behind the very people it claims to serve. If DEI is to have any lasting impact, it must acknowledge and address class inequities, ensuring that those at the lower rungs of the economic ladder are included in the conversation and provided with real opportunities for advancement.

## **Strategies for Moving Forward**
Far from the mistruths being pushed forward by the current administration - DEI is not illegal. NYU School of Law’s has been a leader in helping organizations understand how to build legally defensible and impactful DEI programs.
To ensure DEI fulfills its promise, organizations must pivot toward substantive, systemic change. Here’s how:
**Prioritize Structural Over Symbolic Change.** Shift resources from anti-racism training toward policies that address pay equity, advancement pathways, and inclusive hiring practices.
**Adopt a Data-Driven Approach.** Develop DEI strategies based on empirical evidence, using workforce analytics to assess gaps and measure progress over time.
**Advocate for Policy-Level Interventions.** Partner with policymakers and labor organizations to drive broader reforms that address economic and racial disparities. Without these collaborations, labor shortages and lack of invocation are going to have long term impacts on company bottom line.
**Pressure SHRM To Support Workers.** Urge membership organizations such as to take a firm, pro-DEI stance by advocating for policies that support workplace equity, systemic change, and the protection of marginalized employees.
The failures of DEI’s most recent wave made it vulnerable to attack. But if organizations are willing to embrace a deeper, more data-driven, and class-conscious approach, DEI can evolve into a force for lasting equity rather than a fleeting corporate trend. The moment demands more than performative gestures—it requires bold, systemic transformation.

Advertising spending on women’s sports surged in 2024, more than doubling from the previous year, according to a from TV marketing firm EDO. Women’s basketball attracted the largest share of the investment. With more money flowing into the industry than ever before, these gains could also translate into financial progress for female athletes.
Advertisers spent $244 million on women’s sports in 2024, marking a 139% year-over-year increase. This ad-dollar boom aligns with a spike in women’s sports viewership. For example, over 2 million viewers tuned into game five of the WNBA championship series, making it the most-watched WNBA game in 25 years. And last spring, the women’s NCAA basketball championship game drew a bigger than the men’s title game for the first time.
As part of the advertising analysis, EDO also examined online activity within 2 to 5 minutes after the ads ran and found that the ads placed during women’s sports broadcasts generated 40% more activity than the average primetime commercial. This engagement with the ads suggests that spending will continue to increase.
PROMOTED
## Does More Ad Spending Equal More Pay?
The influx of advertising dollars into women’s sports is a game-changer, but whether it will lead to better pay for female athletes remains to be seen. Although the WNBA is one of the most successful professional women’s sports associations, the pay gap between the WNBA and the NBA remains staggering. According to sports betting site , the average NBA player’s salary is $11.9 million, while WNBA players earn a fraction of that—just $119,590 on average. The disparity is even more glaring at the top. Steph Curry, the NBA’s highest-paid player, rakes in $55.8 million per year, while Jackie Young, the WNBA’s top earner, makes just $252,450.
The massive pay gap has long been to the NBA’s more significant revenue stream. However, the WNBA’s financial issues have been tied to a cyclical problem that impacts many women’s professional sports teams. Without a large audience, it’s difficult for them to secure major media deals and ad revenue, but without those deals, attracting and retaining viewers is nearly impossible. But with advertising spending on women’s sports rising at an unprecedented rate, it may be a sign that the tide is finally turning, setting the stage for long-overdue increases in player pay.
MORE FOR YOU
## Female Athletes As Brand Ambassadors
As revenue and viewership grow, another key factor in closing the pay gap is gaining momentum—endorsement deals. Female athletes are becoming increasingly valuable as brand ambassadors.
According to the EDO study, ads featuring WNBA athletes were twice as effective as the primetime average, delivering stronger consumer engagement. CarMax saw nearly three times the league’s average engagement in ads featuring WNBA superstars Sabrina Ionescu, Chiney Ogwumike, A’ja Wilson and Sue Bird. Meanwhile, New Balance and SKIMS ads featuring Cameron Brink of the Los Angeles Sparks outperformed all others, driving a staggering 1,368% more engagement than the average WNBA ad.
Most notably, ads during WNBA games featuring WNBA players were even more effective than those starring NBA athletes, indicating that female athletes can drive brand engagement. These strong results should result in even more endorsements for female players in the future.
In July, the WNBA also announced a new media rights deal that is predicted to increase revenue and viewership. Starting in 2026, Disney, Amazon and NBCUniversal will distribute more than 125 WNBA regular season and playoff games nationally each season, and the predicts that “you should expect them to invest serious marketing dollars.”
The potential payoff from this media deal is significant. When the National Women’s Soccer League secured a new media rights deal last year, advertising revenue jumped ninefold. If the WNBA follows suit, this investment could also help reshape the financial landscape for the league and its players.

### How to Shop Amid Tariff Uncertainty

As President Donald Trump enacts his , you may be wondering if you can expect higher prices when you shop.
Consumers will likely see the most immediate impact on categories like food, where the cost of price increases tends to get passed on directly, says Duleep Rodrigo, U.S. consumer and retail sector leader at KPMG, a professional audit, tax and advisory services firm. 
Other products, like household goods, experience a more subdued impact, he says. 
“The manufacturer or retailer may decide they want to absorb some of those price increases,” Rodrigo says. 
He adds that in the current economic environment, consumers are very price-sensitive, which makes retailers hesitant to pass on the full brunt of any tariff-driven price hike. 
While shoppers might not have much control over prices, there are steps they can take to minimize any impact on their own bottom lines. 
Here’s how to adjust your shopping habits in an era of tariffs: 
## 1. Prepare your budget for price increases
“You need a budget more than ever,” says Andrea Woroch, a money saving expert who shares budgeting tips on her website, andreaworoch.com. 
A , she says, gives you more control over how you’re spending to help counteract the uncertainty over the impact of tariffs. 
A budget can take the form of an , an envelope-based tracking system or a  to help you track expenses. 
“Without a spending plan, it’s easy to overspend and rack up debt,” Woroch says. 
To get started, she suggests tracking your spending and allotting different amounts to categories such as food, clothing and personal care. You can make adjustments as you go, particularly if prices go up. 
At the same time, setting aside money for an emergency fund can make it easier to absorb temporary price increases without needing to take on additional credit card debt. 
## 2. Compare prices and seek discounts
Look for sales, compare prices between retailers and leverage tools like  websites to find discounts and cash-back offers, suggests Trae Bodge, smart shopping expert at TrueTrae.com, where she provides shopping tips. She adds that using a credit card that offers rewards or cash back can also help stretch your dollars. 
If you’re in the market for consumer electronics or appliances, you might consider buying refurbished items through retailers that offer certification — meaning it’s been inspected and authenticated — and warranties, Woroch says. Checking for “like new” used options when shopping on Amazon can often result in high-quality products for lower prices. 
Resale websites such as Poshmark or SidelineSwap can also offer attractive deals on gently used items, and allow you to earn extra cash by selling products, Woroch adds. Using this method, she was recently able to sell some old toys and clothing and then use her earnings to purchase used skis for her daughter without tapping into savings. 
## 3. Resist pressure to spend early and often
While consumers may feel pressure to make big purchases, like a new car, as soon as possible before tariffs drive prices up any further, that could be the wrong move, says Meir Statman, professor of finance at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University. 
“People don’t always pause and ask whether they actually need it,” says Statman, who is also the author of “A Wealth of Well-Being: A Holistic Approach to Behavioral Finance.”
He adds that buying more than you need can create other costs. If you stock up on beef for a deep freezer, for example, you have to pay for the electricity to keep it frozen. If you buy and store wine for an upcoming wedding months in advance, you might decide you want a different type by the time the big day arrives. 
“There is no product I can think of that you should rush out and buy now,” Statman says. 
Instead, he suggests, consumers should keep an eye on prices and only make purchases when truly needed.

Ten days after the 24-hour consumer blackout called by The People’s Union USA, all eyes are on retail giants Target and Amazon. While the boycott increased public awareness of diversity, equity and inclusion rollbacks, the numbers aren’t telling us much. That said, we might be missing the bigger picture, especially when it comes to what this all means for small businesses.
While in-person traffic to Target’s physical stores and time spent on its mobile app saw measurable decreases during the one-day consumer blackout, they weren’t substantial enough to make a permanent dent. It’s also worth noting that Target has lost something north of $12 billion, according to its statements. That tracks with a before it cut its DEI programs. That the company has to remain flat through 2026 is not nothing. There’s good reason to believe that their next earnings report covering the current climate and at the center of the latest – will paint a substantially less ambiguous picture. With Black consumers _,_ this boycott could be the lightning rod that sparks a much wider movement.
## **The 24-Hour Consumer Blackout Was Neither A One-Off Nor A Hail Mary**
Feb. 28 was neither a one-off nor a Hail Mary. It was a capacity-building exercise. It gave supporters a taste of being a part of what organizing feels like and how to support local and independent businesses. Furthermore, it allowed boycott organizers to capture a growing base of consumers who feel increasingly frustrated that corporate America is abandoning them and their values. It bolstered faith leaders and unions' power to harness this energy into targeted and more sustained boycotts that have a formidable history of forcing demands through organized economic activity. We tend to understand that history in terms of what people didn’t do, or (more accurately) refused to do. Where they refused to spend their money or activities they refused to take part in. Therefore, any reasonable small business might extrapolate a sort of warning. No doubt, the trials of Target loom large for smaller enterprises trying to weather this minefield moment in American history.
PROMOTED
## **Boycotts Are A Redirection – A Reallocation of Spending Power.**
Here’s the thing: Boycotts are not strictly a matter of withholding business. Rather, they’re a redirection – a reallocation of spending power. Most people know Rosa Parks and her role in the Montgomery Bus Boycott that ended with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that segregation on public buses is unconstitutional. What helped sustain the boycott for so long? Small businesses. Many Black-owned taxi companies stepped in to provide rides at the cost of bus fare, allowing Black residents to maintain the boycott.
> _**“When we talk about making America great — you can’t do that without small business.” - Aurora James, founder of The Fifteen Percent Pledge.**_
There is power in numbers and networks. There are small businesses in the U.S. that employ over 61 million Americans, according to the Small Business Administration. And of consumers say they prefer to spend their money on brands and businesses that align with their values.
MORE FOR YOU
## How Small Business Can Lean In And Be Viable Alternatives.
Small businesses have a huge opportunity to seize this moment and lean hard into their values and commitments to creating more space for different voices, thoughts, and ideas —creating a stronger, richer quilt that’s more multifaceted, . That is the heart of DEI.
For example, small businesses can join “,” a commitment to reserve 15% of shelf space for Black-owned businesses.
Small businesses in areas where there are large government layoffs can consider. In Washington, DC mobile mechanic groups like Roda are offering 30% off services for affected federal employees.
Small businesses can also play an instrumental role in building important networks. Some local coffee shops in DC, Maryland, and Virginia are offering free coffee to those impacted by layoffs and a designated spot and time to meet up for weekly networking.
This is also a time to get creative with specialized product lines that show your solidarity in these tumultuous times. For example, before Trump’s inauguration, Penzeys Spices, a company located in over 20 states with over 200 employees, created a specialty pack of _Resist! Seasoning_. The company sent a box of the _Resist! Seasoning_ packets to customers to share with neighbors. They also did a promotion in honor of the victims of January 6th where for every purchase of the specialty seasoning, Penzey’s would donate a box where they "think it will do good."
The operative question is not how small businesses can survive this shifting landscape – it’s whether they will seize the opportunity it presents. Our present moment, however fraught, needn’t be a matter of dodging punches. It can be a case of getting back to basics. Like supply and demand.

Waymo on Tuesday announced it is expanding its service to include another 27 square miles of coverage around the San Francisco Bay Area.
With the expansion, Waymo will now take passengers around Mountain View, Los Altos, Palo Alto and parts of Sunnyvale, California. The -owned company opened its robotaxi service to the general public in San Francisco in June.
Waymo will initially limit the availability of its Silicon Valley service to users of the Waymo One app who are residents with ZIP codes in the area, the company said. Waymo plans to serve more riders across the region over time. The fleet of vehicles that will be in use in the new coverage areas are fully electric Jaguar I-Pace vehicles with Waymo's fifth generation of self-driving sensors, software and other technology.
"Opening our fully autonomous ride-hailing service in Silicon Valley marks a special milestone in our Bay Area journey," Waymo product chief Saswat Panigrahi said in a statement. "This is where Waymo began and where we're headquartered."
Waymo expanded its San Francisco Bay Area robotaxi service last summer into Daly City, Broadmoor and Colma. Its robotaxis do not yet carry passengers to San Francisco International Airport.
A spokesperson told CNBC that Waymo is in "active discussions with SFO," and added that the company is "working to connect" Silicon Valley and San Francisco to "provide seamless autonomous rides across more of the Bay Area in the future."
Waymo also recently launched a commercial , Texas, just in time for the city's annual South by Southwest festival.
While would-be competitors including 's automaker , and -owned Zoox, are continuing their own robotaxi testing and development, Waymo has of self-driving companies in the U.S. 
Before Tuesday's expansion, Waymo said it was serving more than per week across San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix.
Alphabet doesn't disclose financial results for the autonomous vehicle business, but Waymo is part of its "Other Bets." That business unit generated $400 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 and incurred operating losses of $1.17 billion, according to the company's most recent.

These jeans are made of a blend of cotton and CoolMax polyester, which helps wick away moisture throughout the day. A small amount of Lycra gives the fabric a bit of extra stretch. Unlike relaxed-fit jeans, this pair tapers slightly towards the ankle for a more streamlined silhouette.

## How I Chose The Best Jeans For Men
To pick the best men’s jeans, I spent hours researching top menswear brands. I only included styles from brands with stellar overall reputations and overwhelmingly positive customer reviews.
  * I kept Allen’s pointers and advice in mind as I did my research, making sure that my selections were in line with his insights.
  * Once I finalized my list, this roundup was reviewed and approved by Molvar, who tapped into her own knowledge of men’s denim trends.
  * Everyone has a slightly different body type, which is why I featured jeans with a variety of fits, including slim, athletic, straight and relaxed.
  * Budget, too, was also considered; I made sure to include under-$100 pairs (like the ) as well as more expensive investment pieces.


## What To Look For In The Best Jeans For Men
There are a few factors you should keep in mind as you shop for a new pair of jeans, including fit, material and price. Here’s what to consider:
### Fit
According to Allen, finding the right fit comes down to body shape and personal style. The most common jean fits you’ll come across while shopping are slim, straight, relaxed and athletic. “Slim-fit jeans work best for leaner builds or guys with slimmer legs, offering a tailored look without excess fabric,” he says. “Straight-leg jeans are the most versatile, suiting most body types by balancing room and structure.” If you have a broader build or muscular thighs, Allen recommends a relaxed fit—this is also a good option for anyone who simply wants a bit of extra comfort throughout the seat and leg. And finally, athletic-fit jeans are “cut for guys with beefy legs who need more room up top but still want a clean, tapered finish,” Allen explains.
### Material
Not all denim is created equally. Some denim fabric is 100% cotton, while others are blended with a hint of spandex or elastane for a bit of stretch. Allen’s preference is high-quality 100% cotton, preferably selvedge, with a tight weave and mid-weight; however, if you prefer a bit more flexibility, you’ll likely feel more comfortable in stretch denim. Signs of a well-made pair of jeans go beyond the fabric itself. “Construction details like chain-stitched hems, reinforced stress points and quality hardware indicate durability, which means your jeans will last for years,” says Allen.
### Price
When it comes to men’s jeans, it’s worth it to spend a bit more up front to ensure you’re getting a high-quality pair. “A good pair of jeans typically falls in the $150 to $300 range, depending on the brand, fabric and construction,” says Allen. That being said, it’s possible to find a good pair for under $150—just keep in mind that less expensive jeans typically have a lighter fabric weight and aren’t as durable as their pricier counterparts.

## Topline
Even the world’s richest man has bad days, as Elon Musk faced a litany of headaches to start the week Monday—including the of his social media site, an in his net worth as his primary venture Tesla faced brutal losses, while an awkward TV interview only gave critics more fodder.

## Timeline
March 10, 8:54 a.m. EDTMusk’s Monday gets off to an immediate bad start as users on his X platform to report widespread outages, with Musk later the crash to a “massive cyberattack” from “a large, coordinated group and/or a country” and noting the problem emanated from “IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area” (cybersecurity expert Cliff Steinhauer Forbes it was likely too early to determine the root of the issue).
March 10, 9:42 a.m.Musk shockingly veteran and retired astronaut Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., a “traitor” after Kelly posted support for Ukraine following a visit to the country, including Kelly’s wife —and even one House Republican, Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., to criticize him, with Bacon CNN Musk’s accusation was “not right” and “reflects bad on the White House” (on Musk’s own platform, his “traitor” comment received only 15,000 Likes by Tuesday morning compared to over 230,000 likes for ).
March 10, 3:45 p.m.Left-leaning watchdog organization Media Matters, a longtime Musk target, X for bringing lawsuits against it in foreign countries as part of "a vendetta-driven campaign of libel tourism,” the suit alleged.
March 10, 4 p.m., the primary source of Musk’s wealth, ends Monday trading down more than 15%, its worst daily loss since September, as the electric vehicle maker became the most notable loser of the Wall Street losses tied to shaky investor sentiment amid President Donald Trump’s tariffs—Tesla stock closed more than 10% lower than it did prior to Trump’s election, wiping out what was once a more than 90% rally, and shares declined over 50% in less than three months.
March 10, 4:30 p.m.Musk sits down with Fox Business’ “Kudlow” and does little to assuage Tesla investor angst, —in a halting way that went viral on social media— that he’s juggling his Department of Government Efficiency role with his positions at Tesla and his other companies “with great difficulty” and invokes Monty Python, adding to “always look on the bright side of life."
March 10, 4:56 p.m.Responding to a thread on Monday being the seventh-worst day in Tesla stock’s 15-year history, Musk , “It will be fine long-term.”
March 10, 10:13 p.m.A federal judge against DOGE for operating with “unprecedented power” and “unusual secrecy,” ordering Musk’s agency to comply with public record requests and increase its transparency.
March 10, 10:18 p.m.Musk the “antibody reaction is strong” to a post suggesting Musk “will be blamed for everything,” including the “incoming .”
March 11, 12:14 a.m. Musk’s bossTrump chimes in to support Musk after his bad Monday, on his Truth Social site he will buy a Tesla “as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American.”
March 11, 8:22 a.m. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, long one of the most outspoken voices on Wall Street in Musk’s and Tesla’s corner, publishes a critical note on Musk, saying patience is “wearing very thin” and Musk “needs to step up as Tesla CEO at this critical juncture” as there’s been “little to no sign of Musk” at any Tesla facility since Trump took office.
## Big Number
$22.8 billion. That’s how much Musk lost off his net worth during Tesla’s Monday nosedive, according to our . That’s more than the entire $22.7 billion fortune held by media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
## Forbes Valuation
Musk’s $325 billion net worth still makes him by far the wealthiest person in the world with a $110 billion lead over the next richest man, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ($215 billion net worth).
## Crucial Quote
“The Musk DOGE distractions” have “created a black cloud over Tesla's stock” according to Ives.
## Tesla Stock Bounces Back Some Tuesday
Shares of Tesla gained as much as 6% Tuesday morning, bouncing off of their lowest close since October, before settling into a 1% advance by 11 a.m. EDT, as the market broadly dropped on Trump’s to increase tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel imports to 50%. Tesla’s 2025 losses are staggering, as its nearly 45% year-to-date decline makes it the worst-performing company listed on the S&P 500, according to FactSet data.

When Best Buy launches its new U.S. marketplace this summer, it won't just be expanding its product assortment—it'll be laying the foundation for a more robust advertising business. While retail media leaders Amazon and Walmart have built diversified advertising revenue streams through thousands of marketplace sellers, Best Buy's opportunity lies ahead. By creating a vibrant third-party marketplace, Best Buy can potentially monetize more searches, tap into a new base of advertisers beyond its current stable of major brands, and introduce new ad formats tailored to an expanded product selection.
As CEO Corie Barry noted in the company’s earnings call last week, these two priorities are "intertwined," with the marketplace expected to "provide opportunities for Best Buy Ads through new advertisers and increased traffic."
When Best Buy abandoned its first marketplace attempt in 2016, retail media networks barely existed in their current form. Today, the landscape has transformed dramatically—with marketplace-based retailers consistently outperforming their non-marketplace counterparts in advertising revenue potential.
PROMOTED
## Second Time's The Charm?
This isn’t Best Buy’s first attempt at a marketplace. The electronics retailer launched an online marketplace in 2011 and operated it for five years before shuttering the business around 2016.
But the retail environment has evolved significantly since then. Best Buy's timing for this second marketplace attempt aligns with two significant trends: the maturation of retail media networks and increased sophistication around marketplace operations.
MORE FOR YOU
Best Buy is partnering with Mirakl, an enterprise marketplace technology company that works with major retailers including Macy’s and Kroger, to build its new platform. The retailer also has the advantage of learning from its Canadian marketplace operation, which has been running successfully for several years.
"This is one of those places where we have a distinct advantage in that at least some portion of the company has been dealing with Marketplace," Barry told analysts during the company’s Q4 2025 earnings call. An analyst on the earnings call cited a statistic that in Best Buy’s Canada marketplace, one in every four items shipped is from a 3P seller, which could provide a potential roadmap for U.S. growth.
## The Marketplace-Advertising Connection
While expanding product selection is certainly one motivation for launching a marketplace, the advertising potential may be even more compelling. Best Buy's leadership made this connection explicit in their recent communications with investors, positioning Best Buy Marketplace and Best Buy Ads together as key components of their fiscal 2026 strategy to "launch and scale incremental profit streams."
This approach follows a pattern established by the most successful retail media networks. Doug McMillon, Walmart's CEO, articulated this strategy clearly in 2022: “Growing our marketplace expands choice for our customers, helps our sellers grow, and enhances our profit margins. As we bring more customers, sellers, and suppliers into our ecosystem, it expands our ability to monetize those relationships... And as our e-commerce business, including marketplace, continues to grow, so will our advertising business.”
In , Walmart said its Marketplace grew 34% in the U.S., and Walmart Connect revenue grew 24% year over year – incredible growth within a company that grew 4.1% overall. And Walmart calls out advertising specifically as a high margin business, driving increased operating income.
## The Long Tail Advantage
One of the most compelling reasons for Best Buy to build a marketplace is to create a more diversified advertiser base. According to research from Pentaleap and Colosseum Strategy, Best Buy currently has a compared to marketplace-based competitors. (Disclaimer, Pentaleap is a client of mine)
The bigger the retail media network, the longer the 'tail' of advertisers.
Pentaleap, Colosseum Strategy
While Amazon derives 58% of its ad impressions from "long-tail" advertisers (those representing less than 0.2% of overall impressions) and Walmart achieves 46%, Best Buy gets just 3% from this diversified base. Instead, 77% of Best Buy’s ad impressions come from a handful of major brands—creating vulnerability if any of these advertisers reduce spending.
This concentration challenge isn’t unique to Best Buy. The research notes that non-marketplace retail media networks typically see only 15% of ad impressions come from mid- and long-tail advertisers, compared to 54% for marketplace-based networks.
A small brand portfolio is risky for RMNs.
Pentaleap, Colosseum Strategy
A robust marketplace helps solve this problem by bringing in hundreds or thousands of smaller sellers who then become potential advertisers. These sellers often have stronger incentives to advertise, as they need visibility to compete with established brands and first-party products.
“The biggest digital ad businesses in existence today—including Google and Meta—also thrive on their long tail of advertisers,” says retail industry analyst, Andrew Lipsman. "This wide base not only provides a sturdy foundation on which to grow, it also inoculates the platform against spending cuts from any single advertiser."
## Seller Perspective: Mixed Response
Early reaction from potential marketplace sellers has been mixed, according to interviews with several brands in the consumer electronics space.
Bernie Thompson, founder of Plugable Technologies (which makes laptop docking stations and USB products), expressed enthusiasm about being among the early brands accepted into the marketplace. "We’re excited to be among the early brands accepted into Best Buy’s new Marketplace," Thompson told me. "Best Buy is synonymous with electronics. We think it's a great fit and hope we can make a positive impact for Best Buy and their customers."
Thompson sees an opportunity for Best Buy to differentiate itself through better curation. "Amazon has a sophisticated but chaotic curation system... that also has long-standing flaws that lead to an increasing number of fly-by-night Chinese brands on the platform. Best Buy has an opportunity to stand out if it can establish and maintain the big 5: selection, pricing, speed of delivery, customer trust, and brand trust."
However, others express concerns about potential channel conflict. One consumer electronics brand executive, speaking on background, noted that "we have authorized 3P sellers that are eager to sell on the Best Buy marketplace which creates channel conflict and ultimately creates a situation where we compete against ourselves."
Rahul Saraswat, SVP of Ecommerce at Aventis Systems, a company that sells consumer electronics and IT hardware across multiple marketplaces, said his company would "try out this marketplace for sure" given the natural fit with Best Buy's customer base. However, he added that "a lot will depend on how well the marketplace does and how favorable or unfavorable the costs and terms are."
On the advertising connection, Saraswat was more skeptical about whether retail media spend follows marketplace presence proportionally. "For us, they do not because Amazon is the 10 thousand-pound gorilla in the room. We are an Amazon-first business, and most of our Ad spend dollars support that channel."
## Building a Differentiated Marketplace
Best Buy’s US marketplace appears to be taking a somewhat different approach than its Canadian counterpart. While the Canadian marketplace has historically focused more on refurbished and rebuilt products, CEO Corie Barry indicated the U.S. version will offer "even more new products" and "multiple versions of the same SKUs."
The company is also planning phased implementation of seller-friendly features. At launch, Best Buy will facilitate product returns at physical stores, with "capabilities such as fulfillment as a service for sellers" coming later. This fulfilment capability is a significant enabler for third party resellers. A strong draw for both Amazon and Walmart’s marketplaces is the ability for sellers to tap into the logistics capabilities of those retailers. Not having to store inventory or fulfill orders makes the platform accessible to more sellers. Having orders fulfilled by Best Buy also engenders more trust among consumers.
To protect its brand reputation, Best Buy emphasizes that "all potential sellers will go through a vetting process, so we can ensure our customers receive the positive experience that they would expect at Best Buy."
## Financial Expectations
Despite start-up costs and potential cannibalization of first-party sales, Best Buy's leadership expects the marketplace to have "a positive impact on our operating income rate" in fiscal year 2026, though they declined to provide specific revenue projections.
CFO Matthew Bilunas told analysts in the earnings call, "We would see both [Marketplace and Ads] to continue to present, I would say, some revenue and profit opportunities as we move forward... those would both be contributors to helping us expand an operating income rate as we get into the next couple of years."
The marketplace launch is targeted for mid-2025, meaning its full financial impact won't be felt until the following fiscal year. However, the company's leadership clearly views it as a long-term strategic investment rather than a short-term revenue boost.
As retail continues to evolve, Best Buy's marketplace relaunch demonstrates how thoroughly the playbook has changed since 2016. For today's retailers, a marketplace isn't just about expanded selection—it's about building the foundation for a more sustainable advertising business with a diverse base of smaller advertisers complementing established brand relationships. The success of Amazon and Walmart suggests this strategy works. The question now is whether Best Buy can execute it effectively the second time around.

## Key Facts
Fox Business’ Larry Kudlow asked Musk in an interview how he is running his other businesses while simultaneously dedicating time to politics and DOGE, to which Musk replied, “With great difficulty,” before taking a long pause and sighing.
“But there’s no turning back, you’re saying?” Kudlow then asked, drawing another pause from Musk, who then said he is “just here trying to make government more efficient, eliminate waste and fraud and so far we’re making good progress.”
Musk did not provide specifics on how he is running businesses he serves as CEO of, like SpaceX, xAI and Tesla, the latter company of which traded down over 15% on Monday, sending shares to a low not seen since Oct. 23.
Musk, who said in a Monday Tesla would “be fine long-term,” experienced a $22.8 billion drop in his estimated net worth down to $319.6 billion Monday, though he is still by far the , exceeding the estimated net worths of the next wealthiest people: Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos ($210.8 billion) and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg ($206.7 billion).

## Tangent
Brad Lander, New York City’s comptroller, oversees employee pension funds that own $1.25 billion worth of Tesla shares, according to , which was told by Lander, “We don’t have a C.E.O. who is fully focused on ensuring that Tesla remains a leader in the E.V. space.” Lander also told the Times he wanted Musk to pass his CEO duties to a full-time employee.
## Key Background
Musk has become a key White House figure since President Donald Trump began his term in January, attending alongside Trump and last month and describing his role in government as “tech support.” The billionaire consistently tweets and talks about the work of DOGE, a government agency he unofficially heads that has pushed for government spending cuts and layoffs. Concerns about Musk’s time for the companies he heads or has co-founded were also made public when the billionaire took over Twitter, now known as X, for $44 billion in 2022. Some Tesla investors even the deal for the social media platform as the value of the electric vehicle company was slashed by about 30% after the acquisition was initiated.

### The stock market gets crushed but we were buying — plus, Google hears from Trump's DOJ

Every weekday, the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer releases the Homestretch — an actionable afternoon update, just in time for the last hour of trading on Wall Street. Manic Monday : U.S. stocks got slammed to start the new week, with the Dow closing down 890 points or roughly 2.1%, the S & P 500 down 2.7%, and the Nasdaq down 4%. That's off the lows of the session. A sharp drop in bond yields did not help stocks Monday. Economic fears gripped Wall Street after President Donald Trump went on Fox News Sunday but didn't rule out a tariff-induced recession. He also said he needs to build a "strong country" and "can't really watch the stock market." The worst S & P 500 sector Monday was information technology, led lower by Club names Nvidia and Apple . Communications services also fell sharply, led lower by Club names Alphabet and Meta Platforms . Financials took a hit too: Wells Fargo was the portfolio's second worst performer and Goldman Sachs was not too far behind. Health care, which has recently been strong, lost 1.1% Monday, but Club names Bristol Myers Squibb and Abbott Laboratories both finished in the green. Trade tracker: Our approach on Monday has been the same as last week's flurry of activity – target beaten-up stocks that still have strong fundamental outlooks, while opportunistically trimming outperforming names that have benefited from the market rotation into defensively oriented pockets. Friday's rally snapped the S & P Short Range Oscillator out of oversold territory for the first time in four sessions. But Monday's avalanche of selling will likely put the Oscillator right back into oversold. We started Monday's session with a purchase of CrowdStrike , which has come under heavy selling pressure after providing light guidance for its current fiscal year alongside earnings last week. We followed that up by locking in profits on Abbott, a clear winner from the market rotation, and Linde, which has proven resilient so far this year. We used a portion of those funds to buy more of Goldman, as shares of the investment bank hovered around 20% below their highs reached last month. We used more of the cash we raised Monday morning to scale deeper into our newest position, Capital One Financial . We initiated a stake last Thursday and bought some on Friday, too. We also added to our Disney position, in what will likely be our last trade of the day . We think Disney has a good chance of weathering any slowdown in the consumer. Google news : Shares of Alphabet sank nearly 5% on Monday after the DOJ filed a revised proposed final judgment in its antitrust litigation against the Google parent with only minor changes, mostly retaining the remedies proposed by during President Joe Biden 's term. The Trump DOJ reaffirmed the agency's request for Google to sell its Chrome browser, a key gateway for the company's search services and advertising business, but is no longer compelling Google to sell its artificial intelligence investments, such as its stake in OpenAI competitor Anthropic. Still, Alphabet will be required to notify regulators before making more AI investments. Regulators kept their remedy to ban payments to distribution partners like Apple and Android manufacturers. The ongoing litigation remains a major overhang for Alphabet stock since the outcome could impact Google's business model and market dominance. Google has long argued that too much regulation could impact its ability to compete. Many investors assumed that Trump's administration would take a less aggressive stance on antitrust measures against Big Tech, given he's generally viewed as having a pro-business stance. It's hard to forget the prominent attendance of tech CEOs at the inauguration, including Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, which may have suggested improved relations between Trump and those companies. Yet, MoffettNathanson said the DOJ's latest proposal "shouldn't be a surprise," citing the Tunney Act, which claims that the settlement of antitrust cases serves public interest and "prohibits any change of heart" for the DOJ. Although the government "gave a small bit of ground" for Google to continue its AI investments, the antitrust case "isn't just going away," analysts said. In a note to clients Monday, JPMorgan said the DOJ's remedies "do not provide Google with the relief that many investors had hoped for under the new administration." Jim Cramer has been cautious about Alphabet, which dropped 13% year to date, and the long-term risks the antitrust cases pose to its business. While acknowledging the company's dominance in search and advertising, Alphabet is far from being a bad actor. Jim has suggested that Alphabet's strong market position may not warrant legal action since advertisers can always find other companies to advertise with. At the same time, Jim struggles to see Google Search's potential as chatbot adoption keeps accelerating. However, the Club is balancing those concerns with Alphabet's strength in AI, cloud computing, and YouTube. Up Next : No companies in the portfolio are scheduled to report. Oracle is the biggest name scheduled to report, and we'll be interested to see what co-founder Larry Ellison and company have to say about AI demand and investment.

The whirlwind of e-commerce and its constant evolution poses a very challenging scenario for companies when it comes to optimizing logistics processes. Over time, consumers have become increasingly demanding when it comes to the optimization and delivery time of their packages.
In this context, predictive analytics takes a leading role and also establishes a paradigm shift. Why? Because by analyzing large volumes of data, it's possible to forecast future demand and anticipate possible supply chain disruptions to meet customer expectations.
PROMOTED
## What is predictive analytics, and why is it key to e-commerce logistics?
In addition to the above, predictive analytics makes it possible to identify shopping trendsand predict demand peaks through the use of mathematical models, machine learning and big data analysis. From an e-commerce perspective, this information becomes essential at specific times such as holidays, when companies need to rely on it to determine which products and how many of them will have the best sales during those periods. Without this data, stockouts would likely affect not only the supply chain but also the business's profitability.
## How does predictive analytics improve planning?
Predictive analytics, thanks to its use of data, becomes a fundamental resource to improve business dynamics in the following ways:
• It allows access to historical sales data.
• It identifies seasonal trends.
• It analyzes customer buying behavior.
• It predicts changes in consumer preferences.
As one example, uses predictive analytics to understand which products will be most in demand in specific geographic sectors. Based on that data, it distributes merchandise strategically to meet demand, thus reducing and optimizing logistics resources.
This same technology can be used for smaller retailers to identify more basic patterns and adjust inventory accordingly.
## How does it mitigate supply chain disruption?
Reducing the likelihood of supply chain disruption is a vital function offered by predictive analytics. Among other features, it allows real-time detection of vulnerabilities and delays in transporting goods, whether due to inclement weather or other holdups. Taking predictive analytics into account will enable the adjustment of delivery routes to reduce delays.
## What are the benefits for e-commerce companies?
Once the factors that have the potential to disrupt the supply chain have been identified and the necessary actions have been taken to remedy those issues, e-commerce companies stand to benefit in a number of important ways. First, they canreduce their operating expensesthrough proper inventory planning, optimizing the company's profits in the process. Second, improving delivery times can substantially improve the perception of the company, helping enhance customer confidence. Finally, with the data in hand, it's possible to make concrete decisions that will benefit the company and prevent possible operating and delivery interruptions.
## What are the challenges?
Although predictive analytics offers a range of benefits for e-commerce companies, it's also important to note that it poses some challenges.
First, the quality of the data is a fundamental pillar on which all predictive analytics and strategic decision making is based. If this data is inaccurate or outdated, the analytics results—and subsequent decisions made on these results—will be negatively affected. At the same time, companies that analyze user data mustcomply with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to avoid misuse.
Another consideration is the investment cost of implementing the technology, which, althoughit gains an ROI over time, can be initially costly for a small- or medium-sized company. Finally, not having a contingency plan in place can lead to a technological dependency that can significantly impact the company in the event of a software malfunction.
## Conclusion
In recent years, predictive analytics has been known to be a "nice-to-have" tool used by e-commerce businesses to help make strategic decisions. But for companies that want to stay competitive in a dynamic and increasingly demanding industry, it's quickly become a "must-have" strategic asset. Ultimately, the future of e-commerce lies in the hands of those who adoptpredictive analytics as a key differentiator to help ensure long-term success.

### I have 5 income streams and make over $1 million from Amazon alone: My No. 1 advice for starting a side hustle

Related Stories
Dr. Jenny Woo is the founder and CEO of Mind Brain Emotion.

The idea of working a traditional 9-to-5 in a corporate environment was never for me. I always wanted and the to work on my own terms.
So, over the past two decades, while I was a student, a full-time employee, an academic researcher and a stay-at-home mom, I started a variety of .
Now I have multiple streams of , which include, creating online courses, speaking at companies about, lecturing at universities and impact investing.
Whether selling goods or providing services, my No. 1 advice for anyone starting a side hustle is to develop a clear profitability plan. All too often, I see people diving into their passions without considering how and when they will turn a profit. This oversight can make or break your success. 
Here are three things to keep in mind:
_**DON'T MISS:**_
## 1. Know your numbers 
How much are you willing to invest, and potentially lose, before becoming profitable? Knowing this requires a realistic understanding of your initial net profit margin and ways to boost your profitability.
Your net profit — calculated by subtracting expenses from sales — is the lifeblood of your side hustle. Examples of expenses include materials, labor, equipment, packaging, shipping, advertising, traveling and business subscriptions.
Your profit margin represents the percentage of each sales dollar you keep as net profit. For example, if your product or service sells for $10 and your expenses amount to $8, then your net profit is $2, resulting in a profit margin of 20%. If you've invested $100 upfront, then you need to sell 50 units to break even.
To and boost early profitability, I launched a Kickstarter campaign with a $1,500 goal. This funding covered essential expenses like product manufacturing and jump-started my sales by getting products into the hands of early adopters. 
I needed to sell 60 units to break even but ended up selling over 400 units. This higher sales volume allowed me to manufacture at a reduced cost per unit, which improved my profit margin by lowering my cost of goods sold (COGS).
## 2. Avoid common traps that can harm profitability
I found that there are three traps that can severely undermine the profitability of a side hustle:
**1. Underpricing your services**
When I was selling, I made the mistake of chasing sales over tracking profit. Hoping to establish credibility, I underpriced my products aggressively and went above and beyond in customer service. 
But I soon realized how difficult it was to raise prices once you've set a low-cost precedent. Despite making thousands of sales on Etsy over the course of five years, I ended up having to close my shop due to slim profit margins.
**2. Failing to accurately account for your time**
That experience helped me grasp the difference between running a passion project versus a profitable business.
Recognizing the need for scalability and efficiency, especially when it came to the time I was putting into it, I pivoted to and utilized the automated Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) service to handle logistics.
**3. Overlooking opportunity costs**
I've also stumbled upon similar dilemmas when pricing my . When I first started out, I lowered my fee in hopes of securing contracts from big names like Accenture and Google.
But when they came back the following year, I had to raise my fees significantly because my opportunity costs — the cost of what I could have been doing and earning with my time — outweighed what I was charging. I learned the importance of valuing my work from the start.
## 3. Begin with the end in mind, and put yourself first 
Over the years, I've developed a more expansive definition of profitability. It isn't just about money. Profitability is also about how this venture affects your quality of life. Your physical and mental well-being come first.
To see if your side hustle is truly profitable, ask yourself:
  1. How much money am I willing to invest in my side hustle?
  2. How much time am I prepared to dedicate to my side hustle?
  3. Is my goal to make my side hustle into my main hustle?
  4. At which point do I pivot if the reality is not matching my answers to these questions?


It's been exhilarating to see my hard work pay off. But this process has also required me to have a very clear understanding of what I value the most, and to get comfortable with saying "no." Without that foundation, none of my success would have been possible.

For all of the advancements in modern fitness technology, one of the latest viral crazes is remarkably simple: a **headband with a ball attached by a stretchy string**.
Boxbollen like Khloé Kardashian, Conor McGregor, Tom Brady and Snoop Dogg, a strategy that hasn’t been cheap—Boxbollen has reinvested as much as 50% of its revenue into its marketing. But it’s paid off: In 2024, the company posted $59.2 million in revenue, its best year yet.
“The question is sustainability,” a retail analyst told _Forbes_. “[A] $50 million business can grow into something larger, or it could fade away. … It’s hard to know what a $50 million business looks like a decade out.”

President Donald in an interview Sunday with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo, “There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big.” Last week featured a **dizzying amount of tariff news** , and Trump on Friday said on some Canadian goods, despite previously delaying the 25% levies on Canadian and Mexican goods for a month.

Cracks are **starting to show in the labor market** , as , according to the Labor Department.

### **TECH + INNOVATION ​​**

Elon Musk claims Tesla is not an electric car maker, but rather an AI company that can become the most valuable in the world—thanks to **the data it collects from its cars**.In theory, it could help train vehicles to operate without human assistance, but that data : Training AI on videos of people driving down highways doesn’t do much to help the AI learn how to handle the most critical edge cases that cause collisions or other dangerous scenarios.
Federal investigators caused one victim to**lose XRP cryptocurrency that is now worth some $716 million** , due to a massive spike in crypto values following the election of President Donald Trump. It’s already been a big year for massive crypto thefts, after hackers stole $1.5 billion from the ByBit exchange in February, in what was dubbed the biggest crypto heist in history.
### MONEY + POLITICS
Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and other insiders at Dominari Holdings, a Nasdaq-listed wealth management firm, —**the day before it was announced that the Trump brothers would join** its advisory board. The timing probably does not violate insider trading laws, experts told _Forbes_ , but raises questions about whether directors acted in the company’s best interests by selling the shares cheaply to themselves.
Senator Elizabeth Warren on Friday sent a letter to President Donald Trump’s crypto and AI czar David Sacks and**asked him to make his financial disclosures with the government public** , days after Trump announced the creation of an American crypto strategic reserve. In her letter, Warren asked how Sacks intends to prevent “the President and other private individuals from directly profiting off of the Trump Administration’s efforts to selectively pump the value of certain crypto assets.”

The tool is used by governments at all levels to send out important warnings and reminders to citizens, but sources tell _Forbes_ most of the team that manages it have been “fired, transferred, or have resigned.”
### SCIENCE + HEALTHCARE
The CDC is between vaccines and autism**,** a link that has been pushed controversially by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Kennedy was among the most well-known public figures **spreading the long-debunked theory** for years, and health experts have widely condemned his stance.
_MORE_ : Health officials in Maryland last week, **unrelated to outbreaks of the disease in Texas and New Mexico**. Measles was announced as being eradicated in the U.S. in 2000, given the success of vaccines in eliminating the disease, though outbreaks of the virus have still popped up among the unvaccinated.
### **WORLD**
President Donald Trump said Friday he is on Russia to **compel an end the Russia-Ukraine war** , but hours later, he said “it may be easier dealing with Russia” compared to Ukraine. The warnings contradict a Reuters report earlier last week that the White House was considering easing sanctions against Russia to improve relations as it works to negotiate a ceasefire and permanent end to the conflict.
## **DAILY COVER STORY**
“One of the biggest opportunities in the country," says Kettle & Fire cofounder Justin Mares, "is building a better type of food company that thinks about human health.”
KETTLE & FIRE
**TOPLINE** Kettle & Fire cofounder Justin Mares’ quest to sell what he **considers healthier food to some of the most health-obsessed customers** on the planet has fueled his bone broth brand for nearly a decade.
Kettle & Fire has also spent the past nine years pioneering a return to what the soup and stock aisles used to look like—products filled with fortifying natural ingredients. It’s no longer a niche product: Cartons of Kettle & Fire are **now sold at 22,000 stores nationwide** , from Whole Foods to Walmart and Target, as well on its own website and at Amazon, Walmart.com, Thrive Market and more. Kettle & Fire has some of the highest repeat purchasing rates across grocery store soup aisles industry-wide, and the brand has brought in new customers to a once-sleepy category.
Despite its growth, Mares wants the company to remain private, for now, and keep growing on his own terms. To that end, he and his brother bought out their early backers at the end of last year with the help of independent board member Sam McBride, who founded the Chicago-based Colter Ventures. McBride raised additional funds from new investors, which valued Kettle & Fire at an estimated $200 million, or roughly double its revenue.
With that kind of momentum behind Mares, he is now emboldened to **scale up his business and begin selling** what he deems as healthier food on a mass scale. “I have a vision much more than an investor does around what the food system should look like,” he says. “With what I want to build in the world, it’s much easier to realize your vision if you have more control.”
**WHY IT MATTERS** Kettle & Fire cooks its products for 14 to 20 hours and sources grassfed beef with a strict set of standards to ensure high levels of collagen, amino acids, and vitamins and minerals. Mares and his team also **remove the kinds of additives and ingredients** like seed oils targeted by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and the Make America Healthy Again crowd. Kennedy has touted the benefits of bone broth on social media, and podcaster Joe Rogan, who has extolled the benefits of the carnivore diet for years, is also a big fan of bone broth.
**MORE**
## FACTS + COMMENTS
Retailers of any private-sector industry last month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But that **could be just the tip of the iceberg** :
**6,300:** The number of jobs the retail industry lost in February, second only to food services and drinking establishments, which lost 27,500 positions
**19,000:** The number of jobs cost from the bankruptcy of crafts retailer Joann, and another 16,000 jobs were lost from Party City
**Up to 15,000:** The number of stores that retailers are expected to close this year, more than double the amount that closed in 2024
## STRATEGY + SUCCESS
With all the talk of tariffs, layoffs and more, . **Focus on the things you can control** : For instance, come up with a Plan B, like a side hustle to earn extra income. Exercise self-care and immerse yourself in the things that bring you joy, and don’t leave your financial situation up to chance—keep track of the money coming in and out. And remember that the unknown can have positive outcomes, too.

The last posting on March 6 analyzed the prospects for four of the Magnificent Seven or the “Fab” Seven as some commentators have renamed the group. Let us apply the same approach to Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), and Tesla. (I added Netflix in the first posting, so we are analyzing the big eight.) The overall stock market is projected to be in a trading range this year. Cycles will be a useful guide in trading the tech heavyweights in 2025.
As we can see below, the Amazon cycle bottoms now. This cycle is synchronized with the Amazon seasonal cycle. From March 3 through July 5, this stock has risen over 80% of the time over the last 27 years. This stock is likely to outperform the technology index.
## Amazon Monthly Cycle

This cycle points to a low now.

PROMOTED
Microsoft cycles are strong until June, but underperformance is likely in the second half of the year. The first half of any year has been bullish. Over the last 38 years, the stock has risen 74% of the time. The cycle is the weakest of the stocks that are under review in the second half of 2025, projecting a weak close to 2025.
## Microsoft Monthly Cycle

This cycle advises us to sell in May. 
Cycles Research Investments LLC
MORE FOR YOU
The Alphabet monthly rhythm is different from that of most of the other stocks. It traces out a 2025 trading range. There is a low in May followed by a July peak. There is a late October low followed by a strong Q4. Trade the stock.
## Alphabet Monthly Cycle

This stock is in a 2025 trading range.
Cycles Research Investments LLC
Tesla peaked before the overall technology stock decline. The stock followed its cycle down. The cycle falls into early June and then rallies for most of the rest of the year. June has been the single strongest month in any year, so the dynamic cycle low is reinforced by the low in the seasonal cycle.
## Tesla Monthly Cycle
![TSLA](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67cec44438ae4e52c4c7fac4/TSLA/960x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=144)

This "private AI" approach addresses critical data security and intellectual property concerns that have limited enterprise AI adoption.
### **What Is Nvidia?**
Nvidia Corporation, founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, began as a graphics processing unit (GPU) manufacturer focused on gaming and visual computing. Over the past decade, the company has transformed itself into the dominant provider of computational infrastructure powering today's AI revolution. Initially designed for rendering graphics, Nvidia's GPUs proved exceptionally well-suited for the parallel processing requirements of neural networks and other AI algorithms.
The company's business model spans hardware and software. Its primary revenue stream comes from designing and selling specialized chips – particularly its data center GPUs like the H100, H200 and the newer Blackwell series – which have become the industry standard for training and running sophisticated AI models. Nvidia's latest Blackwell architecture, particularly the GB200 NVL72 system, offers performance capabilities that are 30 times faster than previous generations for AI inference tasks, positioning Nvidia to maintain its market leadership.
Beyond AI, Nvidia maintains significant gaming, professional visualization, and automotive technology business segments. However, its data center segment, driven by AI adoption, has become the company's most prominent and fastest-growing revenue source, contributing nearly 88% of total revenue. With a staggering market capitalization of $3.4 trillion as of early 2025, Nvidia has captured an astounding in the data center GPU market, benefiting from its technological leadership and the network effects created by its extensive software ecosystem.
## **Comparing AI Capabilities**
Both companies play crucial but fundamentally different roles in the AI ecosystem. While Nvidia provides the foundational infrastructure enabling AI development and scale deployment, Palantir focuses on applying AI technologies to solve specific business and organizational problems. Let's examine their distinct approaches and capabilities.
### **Palantir's AI Capabilities**
Palantir's strength lies in making AI operational and accessible to organizations that lack extensive technical expertise. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) enables clients to implement generative AI and other advanced capabilities within their existing data environments, focusing on the "last mile" problem deriving business value from AI technologies. This approach addresses a critical gap in the market between raw AI capabilities and practical business applications.
What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on AI orchestration rather than fundamental AI research or development. The company excels at building systems integrating various AI models (including those from other providers) with an organization's proprietary data and workflows. This positions Palantir as an AI solutions provider rather than a technology creator, helping clients navigate the complexities of implementation and achieve measurable outcomes.
Palantir is uniquely positioned to capitalize on emerging frameworks like the due to its specialized expertise in integrating disparate systems and data sources. As frameworks enable more AI systems to communicate and share capabilities, the complexity of managing these interactions within regulated, security-conscious environments increases dramatically. Palantir's proven ability to build mission-critical systems that maintain governance while enabling powerful analytics creates a natural entry point for the company to become a key implementation partner for enterprise AI deployments.
### **Nvidia's AI Capabilities**
Nvidia is the fundamental enabler of modern AI, providing the computational infrastructure on which virtually all large-scale AI development depends. Its GPUs have become the de facto standard for training and running sophisticated AI models, with the company maintaining a commanding market share exceeding 80% in AI accelerators. This position gives Nvidia unparalleled influence over the direction and pace of AI advancement.
The company's AI capabilities extend well beyond hardware. Nvidia has developed a comprehensive software ecosystem, including CUDA, its parallel computing platform; various AI frameworks and libraries; and specialized tools for different AI applications. This combination of hardware and software creates significant competitive advantages and switching costs, as AI developers and researchers build their workflows around Nvidia's technology stack.
Nvidia's influence in AI continues to grow through strategic initiatives like the CUDA ecosystem, enterprise-focused AI systems, and partnerships with major cloud providers. The company has evolved from simply selling chips to offering complete AI systems and development platforms. Its newest Blackwell architecture represents significant advances in AI computing capabilities, delivering vastly improved performance and energy efficiency compared to previous generations and helping maintain Nvidia's technological lead over emerging competitors.
## **Financial Performance And Growth Potential**
Both companies have delivered impressive financial results driven by AI adoption, but their scale, profitability profiles and growth trajectories differ significantly. Examining these metrics provides an important context for evaluating their relative investment potential.
### **Palantir's Financials**
Palantir has demonstrated accelerating growth and improving profitability in recent quarters, achieving GAAP profitability for six consecutive quarters as of Q3 2024. The company reported revenue of $2.4 billion for the trailing twelve months, representing year-over-year growth of 27%. This growth has been driven primarily by commercial sector expansion, with U.S. commercial revenue growing at approximately 40% year-over-year, substantially outpacing government revenue growth.
The company's remain robust at approximately 80%, reflecting the software-based nature of its business. Operating margins have improved significantly, reaching 20% on a GAAP basis, as Palantir has reduced stock-based compensation and scaled its business. The company's customer count continues to grow, particularly among commercial clients, surpassing 300 as of the latest reporting period.
Palantir's stock has experienced significant volatility in early 2025. After surging to record highs following strong earnings in early February, the stock retreated sharply amid concerns over potential U.S. defense spending cuts, from its peak. Despite this pullback, PLTR remains 17% higher year-to-date and has quadrupled in value over the past year, reflecting strong long-term performance. Analysts are divided on the recent sell-off—some view it as a buying opportunity given Palantir's central role in federal data initiatives. In contrast, others point to technical indicators suggesting further downside risk if key support levels fail to hold.
### **Nvidia's Financials**
Nvidia has delivered exceptional financial performance, establishing itself as one of the market's strongest growth stories. In its most recent quarter (Q3 fiscal 2025), record Data Center revenue of $30.8 billion, representing a 112% year-over-year increase. Total revenues reached an all-time high of $35.1 billion, up 93.6% from the previous year, while net income grew by 108.9% to $19.3 billion.
The company's gross margins have expanded to approximately 72%, reflecting Nvidia's strong pricing power and the premium value of its AI chips. Operating margins have similarly improved, exceeding 50% on a non-GAAP basis. Net income has grown even faster than revenue, trailing twelve-month earnings growing over 150% year-over-year.
Nvidia's stock has demonstrated remarkable strength, surging 136.7% over the past 52 weeks and significantly outperforming the 's 25% gain. However, the stock trades approximately 11% below its early January 2025 record high, following concerns about DeepSeek's technological breakthrough. Current market sentiment remains decisively positive, with 36 out of 43 analysts maintaining "Strong Buy" ratings on the stock. The mean price target suggests a potential 25.4% upside from current levels, reflecting continued optimism about Nvidia's growth prospects.
## **AI Trends And Cases For Both Nvidia And Palantir**
The accelerating adoption of AI creates distinct opportunities for both companies, though their positioning within this landscape differs significantly. Understanding how broader AI trends affect each company provides an essential context for evaluating their investment potential.
### **The Case For Palantir**
Palantir stands to benefit significantly from the enterprise AI implementation gap, which is the challenge organizations face when moving from AI experimentation to operational deployment. As companies increasingly focus on deriving measurable business value from AI investments, Palantir's expertise in creating practical, production-ready AI applications positions it well to capture this growing market. Their AIP platform addresses the "last mile" problem in AI adoption.
The company's "private AI" approach addresses critical concerns around data security and intellectual property that have limited enterprise AI adoption. By allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance, Palantir offers a solution that balances powerful AI capabilities with enterprise requirements for security and compliance.
Palantir is positioning itself as a critical middleware layer in emerging AI ecosystems, helping organizations safely expose their data to interconnected AI systems while maintaining security and compliance. With accelerating commercial adoption, improving financial metrics, and a long track record of successfully implementing complex systems integration projects, Palantir represents a higher-risk but potentially higher-reward opportunity to invest in the infrastructure layer that will enable practical AI implementation across enterprises and government agencies.
### **The Case For Nvidia**
Nvidia's position as the foundational infrastructure provider for AI development gives it unparalleled exposure to the growth of technology. As AI models grow larger and more sophisticated, the demand for advanced computational capabilities continues to increase, benefiting Nvidia disproportionately given its dominant market position. The company effectively captures value from the entire AI ecosystem rather than competing within specific application segments.
The company's technological lead appears substantial and sustainable, with its newest Blackwell architecture maintaining performance advantages over competitors. CEO Jensen Huang's recent comment about "insane" demand following Blackwell's broad release at the end of 2024 suggests a strong market reception. Major customers' aggressive infrastructure expansion plans further support the outlook for sustained demand growth.
Nvidia's current valuation metrics, including a P/E ratio of 40x, represent a nearly 35% discount to its 10-year average P/E ratio of 60x (March 6, 2025). Based on forward earnings expectations for fiscal 2026 of $4.44 per share, the stock trades at an even more attractive forward P/E of the low 20s. This valuation gap suggests significant potential upside, as the stock would need to appreciate by over 100% just to trade in line with its historical average P/E ratio, assuming current earnings forecasts prove accurate.
## **Risks And Challenges To Know**
Despite their strong positions, both companies face significant risks that investors should carefully consider. For Palantir, competition from established enterprise software providers and specialized AI startups represents a growing threat. Major cloud providers increasingly offer AI implementation and orchestration tools that overlap with Palantir's offerings. The company's exposure to government contracts, particularly in defense and intelligence, creates vulnerability to policy changes and potential defense spending cuts, as evidenced by the recent stock volatility.
Palantir also faces political and reputational challenges related to its government work. This association creates controversy in some markets and may limit its commercial expansion in specific regions or industries. The company's relatively high valuation and recent stock volatility leave little room for execution missteps, with any slowdown in growth likely to result in significant share price fluctuations.
Nvidia faces different but equally substantial risks. The emergence of efficient training methods demonstrated by DeepSeek could potentially impact demand for high-end GPUs, particularly if similar approaches gain widespread adoption. While major customers like Meta Platforms suggest that any training workload reduction could be offset by increasing inference demands, as newer AI models require more computational power for operation, these evolving dynamics create uncertainty.
Competition in the AI chip market is intensifying, with both established players and startups working to develop alternative solutions. The global semiconductor supply chain remains critical to Nvidia's ability to meet surging product demand. While the company has successfully navigated previous supply constraints, maintaining sufficient manufacturing capacity and efficient distribution channels will be crucial for meeting ambitious growth expectations. Despite its strong position, Nvidia's high valuation leaves little room for execution missteps, as evidenced by a 7% decline following Q3 earnings despite strong results.
## **Which AI Stock Is The Better Buy?**
Palantir and Nvidia represent compelling but distinctly different AI investment opportunities, with the better choice depending mainly on investor priorities, time horizons and risk tolerance. For investors seeking exposure to the foundation of the AI revolution with proven financial results at a massive scale, Nvidia represents the more precise choice. Its dominant position in AI infrastructure, exceptional financial performance, and continued technological leadership make it a core holding for those looking to participate in AI's growth trajectory.
Nvidia's broader diversification across multiple segments provides some insulation against volatility in any single market. Its exceptional margins and cash generation offer downside protection, while its proven ability to execute at scale reduces operational risk. Despite a premium valuation, Nvidia's market position, technological moat and the multi-year growth runway for AI infrastructure suggest continued strong performance, with analysts expecting 43.2% year-over-year EPS growth for fiscal 2026.
Palantir offers a compelling alternative for investors seeking a smaller company with potentially higher growth upside and more direct exposure to enterprise AI adoption. Its improving financial profile, accelerating commercial growth, and positioning as an AI solutions provider rather than a pure technology creator differentiate it from other options in the space. Palantir's focus on making AI operational for organizations provides exposure to the "last mile" of AI implementation, representing a substantial market opportunity as enterprises move beyond experimentation to production deployment.
While Palantir has significant long-term potential with its expanding AI and data analytics capabilities, it also faces substantial competitive risks. The company’s reliance on government contracts, niche enterprise solutions, and emerging AI ambitions make it vulnerable to disruption from larger tech players with more diversified offerings. If industry giants like Microsoft, Google or Amazon further develop their AI-driven analytics platforms, Palantir could struggle to maintain its competitive edge. In contrast, Nvidia is a proven market leader with consistent revenue growth, dominant AI and GPU technology and deep industry integration. As one of the key enablers of the AI revolution, Nvidia is shaping the future rather than just participating in it. While PLTR has upside, NVDA carries significantly lower long-term risk due to its brand dominance, scalable technology, and essential role in AI infrastructure.
**Bottom Line**
While Palantir and Nvidia represent strong contenders in the AI space, Nvidia emerges as the superior investment for most investors, given its dominant market position, exceptional financial performance, technological leadership, and crucial role in the broader AI ecosystem. Palantir offers compelling exposure to enterprise AI implementation but comes with higher execution risk and more intense competition. For investors with sufficient capital, a balanced approach might include Nvidia as a core AI infrastructure holding and Palantir as a more minor position offering exposure to enterprise AI solutions. As with any technology investment, maintaining awareness of evolving competitive dynamics and technological shifts remains essential for long-term success.

Since its mid-February high, the S&P 500 has fallen by 7%, with 3% of that decline coming last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a retreat of almost 16% since mid-December. The proximate cause of the pressure on stocks has been an economic growth scare and policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs.

## The Growth Scare
The Atlanta Fed is currently forecasting a decline in U.S. economic growth in the first quarter. Much of the negative revision of its GDP forecast was due to higher imports, which likely spiked to front-run any expected tariffs on imported goods. Thus, this drag is likely to moderate over time.
PROMOTED
The St. Louis Fed uses a different methodology, and its GDP estimate for this quarter is 2.5%. Thus, investors are left with a mixed picture in any case.

## Economic Hard Data
Jobs are the ultimate center of the economy. Generally, if people have jobs, salaries are sufficient to support consumer spending and, thus, economic growth.
The monthly payroll report is considered the gold standard for judging the labor market's health. Last Friday’s data showed that nonfarm payroll jobs grew by a below-consensus 151,000 in February. Perhaps a sign of creeping underlying weakness, hours worked remained at a 5-year low despite moving past the L.A. wildfires and challenging January weather conditions. The unemployment rate rose to 4.1% from 4.0%.

Monthly Job Growth
Glenview Trust, Bloomberg
The four-week moving average for initial unemployment benefits claims has been rising. In addition, continuing claims for unemployment benefits are pushing on multi-year highs, indicating that those losing their jobs are having a more challenging time finding employment again.
The data indicates a softening labor market but is not yet weak enough to signal an imminent recession. Notably, the Sahm Rule has had no false alarms in predicting a recession and remains below the trigger level. The Sahm Rule uses a half-percentage point rise in the three-month average unemployment rate over the low of the previous twelve months to predict an economic downturn.

## Economic Soft Data
The weaker economic data seems to be coming from soft data, like consumer confidence data. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading has fallen to its lowest level since 2023. Unfortunately, survey data can be unreliable as consumers often do differently than they say. On a positive note, the reading has reached these low levels previously without triggering a recession.
![consumer sentiment LT 03072205](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67cd915361157d7913d4aa76/consumer-sentiment-LT-03072205/960x0.png?format=png&width=144)
Consumer Sentiment

Further complicating sentiment data, political affiliation seems to significantly impact the results. Democratic consumer confidence has plunged since President Donald Trump’s election. This is not abnormal because consumer confidence among Republicans was even worse during much of former President Joe Biden’s term.

## Policy Uncertainty: Tariffs
While the tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been mainly postponed as of this article's writing, higher tariffs seem likely to follow. China, steel, and aluminum have already been hit with higher levies.
Taken together, China, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union account for almost 50% of imports in the U.S. Interestingly, following Covid-19 and the last trade war, supply chains have diversified away from China.
![Share of US imports 03072025](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67cd91cfd13586268faef0e3/Share-of-US-imports-03072025/960x0.png?format=png&width=144)
Share Of U.S. Imports: Last 12 Months
Glenview Trust, Bloomberg
While supply chains have reduced their dependence on China, it still has the largest trade surplus with the U.S., which makes it a large target for increased tariffs. Mexico and Canada also have large trade surpluses, so they may remain targets. Notably, the U.S. has significant leverage with Canada and Mexico; their exports to the U.S. make up a large enough portion of their GDP that sizable tariffs from the U.S. would likely force their economies into recession.
The European Union has a significant trade surplus with the U.S., so they are expected to be targeted when the administration proceeds with reciprocal tariffs. Reciprocal tariffs are meant to place U.S. tariffs equal to those experienced by U.S. goods imported into that region.
![Large trade surplus 03072025](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67cd9238581487e8567683da/Large-trade-surplus-03072025/960x0.png?format=png&width=144)
Selected Countries With Large Trade Surplus With The U.S.: Last 12 Months
Glenview Trust, Bloomberg
Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered.
Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. Lastly, the administration can withdraw or focus the tariffs more narrowly if the costs elevate recession risks sufficiently.
## Stock Market Signals
The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This further bolsters the argument that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclicals isn’t at the level seen before past recessions.

Cyclicals Versus Defensives

## Bond Market Signals
Some believe the bond market is a more accurate forecaster of economic fortunes, but it should undoubtedly be part of the mosaic to monitor the economy’s health. While the spreads on high-quality investment-grade corporate debt and high-yield junk bonds are above recent lows, the increase is insufficient to trigger substantial fear of any impending economic downturn. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds.

U.S. Taxable Bond Spreads

The nominal 10-year Treasury note yield ended last week at 4.30%, down from 4.79% in mid-January. This yield decline generally signals declining economic growth expectations or a flight to safety. Looking at a decomposition of the yield, most of the decrease in yield was driven by the real, after-inflation component of the yield, which fell from 2.33% in mid-January to 1.96% and points to economic growth concerns.

## Fed Rate Cuts Coming
As the growth scare has played out, markets have begun to expect more Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025. In early January, expectations for Fed cuts fell to only one for the year but have increased to three, with the first cut expected in mid-June.

Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected

## What To Watch This Week
Though it is released with a significant lag, Tuesday's JOLTS job openings data will be closely parsed for clues as to how quickly the labor market is deteriorating.
The February consumer inflation release will be crucial as inflation has been running hot recently. Some inflation relief could more easily open the door for Fed rate cuts. Consensus and Cleveland Fed estimates are forecasting some improvement, which markets would welcome.

Consumer Inflation Estimate

Lastly, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment is scheduled for Friday. Sentiment is expected to deteriorate further, but this should be taken with a grain of salt.
## Conclusions
While never pleasant, the recent 7% decline in stocks from the peak is well within the average intra-year decline of 14.6% experienced by the S&P 500 over the long term. If the bond market is correct, this is a growth scare and not the beginning of a real economic downturn. The policy uncertainty caused by the threatened tariffs seems likely to drive market volatility. All other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. Typically, if the uncertainty drags on long enough, markets eventually become numb to the perceived threat. Notably, unlike in 2022, bonds have provided a safe haven as stocks have declined, which can help cushion the impact of a portfolio.

S&P 500 Intra-Year Declines
Glenview Trust, Bloomberg
Forecasting stock swings in the short term is a mug's game, so the recent stock declines provide a reminder to keep enough safe assets to fund short-term liabilities. While stocks offer the highest annualized return long-term, they are subject to the whims of sentiment and animal spirits, so they are unreliable for funding short-term needs. did a fantastic job describing the benefits of investing in great companies as a long-term hedge against inflation to retain purchasing power.

Business leaders and investors shaking hands in meeting

I’m constantly asked by younger investors and entrepreneurs which products and companies they should invest in. Often, it’s challenging to find the products that stand out and even harder to find ones that can grow to the point of mass distribution, whether on Amazon, big-box retailers, or other means of ecommerce.
Recently, my company invested in . Did I ever think I would be invested in a fast-growing lighting company? No. But, I’m sure my younger self would have been thrilled, as someone who played many rounds of late-night flashlight tag. However, it wasn’t my love for flashlight tag as a kid that led me on this path. It began with my business partner finding a brand they loved at Tractor Supply Company. As someone who has primarily worked in the marketing world, I know that good products can be out-marketed, and not-so-good products can be great at marketing, and from that fact, that product will become an industry leader.
However, what excites me the most is when a product has a line of that customers love. This investment started with a business partner's love for the product. To me, this is the first step – since an investor or entrepreneur’s appreciation for a product is a large contributor to the product’s success. Below is a simple step-by-step guide on finding great products and evaluating which ones to get behind.
PROMOTED
## 1. Begin With The Leadership
It’s impossible to find a unicorn leader who is skilled at managing products, technologies, people, marketing, sales, and everything else that needs attention in a business. However, the two most important things to me are that they are good people and know their strengths.
Consider asking yourself, “Is this a good person I can trust to help the company on its best path? Are they aware of their strengths and the opportunities someone else can bring to the table?” With LuxPro, I quickly learned that the founder was a brilliant person with a product-focused mindset. However, I also saw clear opportunities for marketing and expanding partnerships. In addition, a seasoned executive was interested in joining the leadership team, which would perfectly complement a product founder.

## 2. Identify What Truly Differentiates The Product
As a business leader and investor, I’ve seen countless friends and peers try to sell me on how their product is different, even when it’s not. Over time, these companies have almost always gone out of business. In my LuxPro example, I highlighted how the founder was an innovation-focused person. But, I think what differentiates the company’s products is their unique functionality and designer patterns.
For example, consider all the remotes or other devices that wouldn’t work unless all batteries have charged. This is not the case with LuxPro flashlights. Its other features, for example, the grip, became a key customer experience factor. Knowing this, the founder then implemented additional pattern options for customers to choose from. The brand’s differentiating qualities were first noticed by my business partner, and when he started getting to know this brand, the clear differentiating factors stood out.
When looking at products, consider asking the customers what they love about them. Recently, my business partner and I learned about another company called . It just so happens that the wife of one of my close friends was using the company’s products. Because of my lily-white skin, I asked her about it. She transparently said she liked the Surface packaging. While it may sound silly, the packaging really matters to my business partner and me, so we always ensure that a company prioritizes quality packaging or at least has plans to improve it. However, the feedback that stuck with me was how much the kids like the sunscreen and how she personally prefers it over other brands. This wasn’t the type of online review that could be gamed or bought; It was a transparent, straightforward review from a trusted source.
## 3. Know Which Channels Are Working And Why
The funny thing about sales is that once one channel works correctly, it can attract other channels. The lighting company example above gained traction by being noticed by a couple of big-box stores that loved the product. Consequently, that paved the way for additional possibilities. With companies like these, sometimes clear growth opportunities present themselves, whether on Amazon, Walmart.com, or other online retailers.
Moreover, it can also fuel other big-box stores to express interest in the product. Big-box retailers typically would rather be one of the first couple of stores to have the product on their shelves or at least one of the stores that stock the product within a reasonable amount of time. Consumers want to frequent retailers where the to them are in stock. Being last to stock products inevitably makes retailers late to the party. Plus, it can affect long-term buying for the big-box stores. This is why the example of my business partner liking a product and talking to customers led to him speaking to a few friends at big-box retailers.
## Applying These Strategies
Overall, these are the key strategies I use to learn more about companies I’m considering investing in. This information gives me a deeper understanding of a company’s purpose and impact, so I know how my support will truly contribute to its growth. While each strategy involves critical thinking and asking thoughtful questions, they are my top recommendations for leaders to consider and implement when seeking industry-leading products to invest in.

# How Kettle & Fire Turned Bone Broth Into A $100 Million Business
Soup Dreams: “One of the biggest opportunities in the country," says Kettle & Fire cofounder Justin Mares, "is building a better type of food company that thinks about human health.”

## Cofounder Justin Mares is fired up about creating new nutrient-rich products for the Make America Healthy Again era.
#### By , Forbes Staff
**B efore launching a new line **of bone broth with Hawaii-based venison brand Maui Nui, Kettle & Fire cofounder Justin Mares put in some real sweat equity a few months ago. Ahead of the deal, he spent three nights in Hawaii with Maui Nui’s crew hunting invasive Axis deer in the dark with a night-vision scope and a long-range rifle. Each animal was killed in its natural surroundings, under the watch of a government inspector of the same sort you’d find at a traditional slaughterhouse. Mares, who carried at least 40 of the slain deer to an ATV waiting nearby that then brought the animals to a mobile butchering facility, experienced firsthand what he considers one of the most ethical examples of small-scale animal slaughter in America. It’s also been good for business.
“There's nothing more nutrient-dense than harvesting a wild animal and turning that into a source of nutrition,” says Mares, explaining how wild meat isn’t usually available for commercial sale, which makes this bone broth so special.
![Mares and Maui Nui_Photo provided by kettle and fire](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67c9e436a937a9ab8cf7f0d6/Mares-and-Maui-Nui-Photo-provided-by-kettle-and-fire/1960x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=144)
Venison, Anyone: Justin Mares—with Maui Nui cofounder Jake Muise and Kettle & Fire CEO Brian Hack—has added a wild game line to Kettle & Fire's bone broth line.
kettle & fire
Mares’ quest to sell what he considers healthier food to some of the most health-obsessed customers on the planet has fueled his bone broth brand Kettle & Fire for nearly a decade. Since he cofounded the brand in 2015 with his brother, Nick, the 35-year-old Mares has built his once-tiny bone broth business into one doing more than $100 million in annual revenue, double what it brought in two years ago. They can’t make enough of it to meet demand. The brand’s loyal fan base, which has bought out its entire range of nutrient-rich soup stocks online for the past five years.
Kettle & Fire cooks its products for 14 to 20 hours and sources grassfed-beef with a strict set of standards to ensure high levels of collagen, amino acids, and vitamins and minerals. Mares and his team also remove the kinds of additives and ingredients like seed oils targeted by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and the Make America Healthy Again crowd. Kennedy has touted the benefits of bone broth on social media and podcaster Joe Rogan, who has extolled the benefits of the carnivore diet for years, is also a big fan of bone broth.
The attention to minutiae when producing the broth is vital. When Mares found out one of Kettle & Fire’s natural flavor suppliers used small amounts of canola oil as a binder, the company stopped working with that supplier and changed to another that used olive oil. Then they banned all natural flavors entirely. Kettle & Fire also pays to certify its broth is free of any residue from the herbicide glyphosate and proudly displays that fact on its label.
“It's hard and unglamorous and non-sexy work. No one cares to this level of detail,” says Mares. “It's crazy that even as a company with decent purchasing power, we have to go so deep with all of these suppliers to understand, how do we buy products and ingredients that are not making people, in my view, sick?”
His fanatical customers agree. Kettle & Fire has also spent the past nine years pioneering a return to what the soup and stock aisles used to look like—products filled with fortifying natural ingredients. It’s no longer a niche product: Cartons of Kettle & Fire are now sold at 22,000 stores nationwide, from Whole Foods to Walmart and Target as well on its own website and at Amazon, Walmart.com, Thrive Market and more. Kettle & Fire has some of the highest repeat purchasing rates across the soup aisle grocery-industry-wide, and the brand has brought in new customers to a once-sleepy category.
![Kettle and Fire_Product Shot_Photo provided by kettle and fire](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67c9e2ca2b9474f42c1a0617/Kettle-and-Fire-Product-Shot-Photo-provided-by-kettle-and-fire/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=144)
Hot Take: “Humans have been eating bone broth for years," Mares says. "The only reason that soup is nutritious is because of the bone broth base."
kettle & fire
“The hardest thing to do is to have the big vision and then to maintain conviction over long periods of time. That’s where [Kettle & Fire] has a unique superpower,” says longtime independent board member Sam McBride, the former COO of Rx Bar (which in 2017). “They saw this coming a long time ago and stuck to their sourcing and standards and they haven’t wavered.”
Despite its growth, Mares wants Kettle & Fire to remain private, for now, and keep growing on his own terms. To that end, he and his brother bought out their early backers at the end of last year with the help of McBride, who founded the Chicago-based Colter Ventures. McBride raised additional funds from new investors, which valued Kettle & Fire at an estimated $200 million, or roughly double its revenue. These investors—who put in $43 million—have what Mares describes as “a long-term time horizon” and are open to seeing a return on their investment from profit distributions or eventually getting bought out, instead of focusing exclusively on a sale or public offering. Mares and his brother Nick are minority shareholders in the deal.
With that kind of momentum behind Mares, he is now emboldened to scale up his business and begin selling what he deems as healthier food on a mass scale. “I have a vision much more than an investor does around what the food system should look like,” he says. “With what I want to build in the world, it's much easier to realize your vision if you have more control.”
Mares will be realizing that vision now as chairman of the board, rather than as CEO, after bringing in a new chief executive, Brian Hack, to take over the day-to-day reins last January. His younger brother, Nick, (when Justin was already 30), hasn’t been involved in daily operations since 2020 when he gave up the COO role, though he remains on the board. (A Peter Thiel fellow from 2016, Nick cofounded another company, Light Labs, which tests for toxins in food. Justin has since cofounded a startup called Truemed,which helps consumers use their HSA or FSA funds for root-cause chronic disease interventions.)
![Justin and Nick_Product Shot_Photo provided by kettle and fire](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67c9e3604210357dad3bd752/Justin-and-Nick-Product-Shot-Photo-provided-by-kettle-and-fire/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=144)
Pain And Gain: Justin Mares (left) first saw the benefits of bone broth at 26, when his younger brother Nick (right) tore ligaments in his knee.
kettle & fire
“Justin is a very big picture thinker,” Hack says of his predecessor. “His awareness of where the consumer is going is really helpful for being a forward-thinking organization.”
J**ustin Mares** was first convinced about the benefits of bone broth at 26when Nick, then 19, tore two ligaments in his knee while playing soccer. A Crossfit enthusiast, the older Mares quickly came to believe that better omega-3 ratios and full-spectrum amino acids such as collagen and gelatin can improve health and fitness recovery. He also discovered that there was a large market of people who wanted access to nutrient-dense broth for other benefits such as gut or hair health. But the market was untapped: He couldn’t find a single brand selling shelf-stable, 100% grassfed bone broth.
While bone broth has been a staple of Chinese medicine for thousands of years, it also has a commercial history in America. It was once the base of many Campbell’s soups, but what’s found in most supermarkets today is oftenreformulated from powders with nutrients added back in. Many of the mass-produced soup stocks today don’t even begin with actual bones.
“Over the last 40 to 50 years, we've gone from using nutrient-dense whole foods with long cook times and traditional methods to using bad cuts of muscle meat, bad cuts of bones, cooked for short periods of time with a bunch of natural flavors and additives added to give you the fake umami flavor,” Mares says. “Humans have been eating bone broth for years. The only reason that soup is nutritious is because of the bone broth base and no one's doing that sort of traditional method anymore.”
The Mares brothers set out to produce a broth that would be slow-simmered for nearly an entire day. From the outset, they committed to high standards of sourcing humanely raised beef and chicken bones—from animals that graze on grass their entire life, unlike some meat labeled _grassfed_ which comes from animals that are fattened on corn at the end of their lives. That’s why Kettle & Fire promotes its sourcing of grassfed-and-finished bones. (Some several peer-reviewed studies corroborate the health claims. In 2010 found higher levels of vitamins A and E, as well as cancer-fighting antioxidants. And in 2022, two studies that grassfed meat as well as other nutrients.
Kettle & Fire’s launch also coincided with the rise of the Paleo diet—which emphasized foods like organ meats and seasonal fruit that are said to have been consumed in the stone age— as well as the meat-heavy Keto diet (focusing on high fat and low carbohydrates). According to grocery industry tracker SPINS, sales of foods labeled Paleo and Keto are each up between 20% and 30% compared to last year, with $750 million in Paleo sales and $500 million of Keto sales.
“The consumer is starting to realize that you can't really divorce nutrient density from quality,” Mares says. “If you're sourcing your animals from factory feedlots and you're using short cook times, you're not using great ingredients. Structurally, that product is going to be much less nutrient dense, much less good for you.”
Mares isn’t just evangelical about his products, it’s part of the company’s ethos. While at yogurt maker Chobani’s emerging food incubator in 2016, Mares learned how the brand’s struggled after bringing in outside investors that didn’t really value the company’s unique culture and standards. Ulukaya eventually bought out those backers and has since committed to Chobani remaining privately held and backed 100% by himself.
Adapting Ulukaya’s strategy for Kettle & Fire, the Mares brothers were stringent when it came to fundraising and raised a little under $1 million in 2016. Two years later, they raised another $16 million in venture funding. Los Angeles-based Cavu Consumer Partners led that round.
Over the next 18 months, Kettle & Fire used that cash to expand from 3,000 grocery stores to 10,000. Sales topped $35 million as the business grew to encompass a line of soups as well as a Keto-friendly line that’s high in protein.
Helped by these broader offerings, Kettle & Fire first became profitable in 2020. Over the next two years, the brand launched at Costco and Walmart, causing sales to rocket.
Kettle & Fire’s core line is a beef and chicken bone broth. There is also a “regenerative” line of chicken and beef bone broth launched in 2021, which touts the environmental benefits of the farms where the bones come from. _Regenerative_ has no official definition when it comes to labels regulated by the federal government, but Kettle & Fire uses it because its chicken and beef suppliers utilize , including keeping living roots in the soil and growing a diverse range of crops. (The suppliers are certified by Whole Foods as well.)
“It's not our most profitable line. But we want to be one of the first brands actually moving the food system in a good direction,” says Mares. “I want to find more opportunities to invest in this idea of nutrient density.”
Then there’s the just-launched line of venison bone broth with Maui Nui—which its cofounder and CEO Jake Muise describes as “way more akin to wild salmon fishing than ranching.” Kettle & Fire is looking for more collaborations like this—including bison broth—going forward. These new products and others will all soon be made in a facility Kettle & Fire owns, once the brand’s first manufacturing plant opens in Lancaster, Pennsylvania this spring and hires 150 new employees.
“One of the biggest opportunities in the country is building a better type of food company that thinks about human health,” Mares says, “and does not look at how we make the most addictive, high-margin, hyper-palatable product that may have a lot of health consequences.”

Organizations Saving Millions By Embracing Curiosity—Here’s The Proof
getty
Jim McKelvey never set out to disrupt the financial industry. He wasn’t a banker, an economist, or even a tech entrepreneur at the time. He was a glassblower. One day, he lost a sale simply because he couldn’t accept a credit card payment. That frustration could have ended with a shrug, but instead, McKelvey did something that defines the world’s most innovative leaders—he questioned the status quo. He embraced curiosity. He wondered, “ _Why is it so difficult for small businesses to process card payments?”_ That single question launched a journey that led to the creation of Square, the financial technology company he co-founded with Jack Dorsey.
McKelvey quickly realized that the barriers preventing small businesses from accepting digital payments weren’t technical—they were systemic. Banks had built financial systems that worked for large corporations but often left small merchants out of the equation. Rather than accepting those limitations, McKelvey’s curiosity drove him to explore solutions. Square reshaped an entire industry, proving that curiosity is a financial advantage. His refusal to settle for “the way things have always been done” turned into a billion-dollar company, survived an aggressive attack from Amazon, and redefined how small businesses operate in a digital world.
But McKelvey’s story isn’t unique. The same pattern appears across industries—companies that embed curiosity into their culture significantly outperform those that don’t. A new builds on existing research to confirm this. Fifty-one C-Suite executives were surveyed across various industries and found that more than 80% of organizations leveraging curiosity-driven initiatives save anywhere from $100,000 for smaller organizations to over $1 million for larger organizations annually. The financial impact is clear: businesses that prioritize curiosity solve problems faster, innovate more effectively, and build greater resilience against disruption.
PROMOTED
Yet, despite these undeniable benefits, too many leaders still treat curiosity as an abstract cultural value—nice to have, but not essential. This is a costly mistake. The most successful companies don’t just allow curiosity; they operationalize it. They create structures that encourage exploration, reward critical thinking, and dismantle the invisible barriers that prevent employees from asking tough questions. When curiosity is embedded into daily operations, it transforms decision-making, strengthens adaptability, and reduces risk—not by avoiding change, but by embracing it before competitors do.
In today’s fast-moving market, developing a culture of curiosity is a survival strategy. Companies that fail to nurture it risk stagnation, higher turnover, and a slow descent into irrelevance. The financial case for curiosity is no longer a matter of speculation. It’s measurable, repeatable, and essential. The question isn’t _whether_ leaders should invest in curiosity. The question is: can they afford not to?

## The Hidden Connection Between Creating a Culture of Curiosity And Financial Benefits
Despite its clear benefits, curiosity remains undervalued in many organizations. Leaders frequently claim they encourage curiosity, yet research shows a stark divide between perception and reality. A study by found that while 83% of executives believed their organizations encouraged curiosity to a great or good extent, only 52% of employees agreed. Even more telling, 49% of executives thought curiosity was rewarded through salary growth, but only 16% of employees shared that view, with 81% stating it made no difference in their compensation. This disconnect has serious financial implications—when employees don’t feel curiosity is genuinely supported, they are less likely to challenge assumptions, propose new ideas, or engage deeply in problem-solving, leading to stagnation and inefficiency
The that curiosity slows execution or creates inefficiencies is one of the most damaging misconceptions in business today. This new research found that organizations that prioritize curiosity actually experience increased productivity, as employees who feel encouraged to explore alternative approaches frequently discover more effective ways to streamline operations and eliminate waste. The long-term consequences of ignoring curiosity include a culture of complacency, where employees feel disengaged and hesitant to voice ideas that could lead to breakthrough innovations.
A prime example of the power of curiosity in action can be seen in fintech and e-commerce companies that continuously iterate on their products based on customer behavior. Firms like Square, co-founded by Jim McKelvey, thrived not because they followed traditional banking practices, but because they asked better questions about what customers truly needed. McKelvey has often spoken about how curiosity was the foundation of their business model, allowing Square to redefine payment solutions and disrupt the financial services industry.
Companies that neglect curiosity risk far more than just inefficiency—they risk obsolescence. In contrast, organizations that actively embed curiosity into their business strategy are the ones shaping the future, adapting ahead of market shifts, and continuously evolving.
It is critical to determine the immediate and measurable impacts of curiosity on workplace efficiency. Companies that encourage curiosity report lower inefficiencies because employees actively seek better ways to complete tasks, reducing wasted time and unnecessary expenditures. Rather than adhering to rigid processes that may no longer serve their purpose, and propose more effective alternatives, leading to cost reductions and streamlined operations.
Employee retention is another critical area where curiosity delivers financial benefits. Organizations that foster curiosity create an environment where employees feel engaged, empowered, and motivated to develop their skills. This, in turn, reduces turnover, which is one of the most expensive hidden costs in business. According to Gallup’s research published in the article _42% of Employee Turnover is Preventable but Often Ignored_ , replacing leaders and managers can cost around 200% of their salaries, while replacing professionals in technical roles can cost 80%, and frontline employees about 40% of their salaries. Companies that fail to cultivate curiosity often experience stagnation, where employees feel uninspired and disconnected from their work, increasing the likelihood of attrition.
Curiosity also leads to smarter, more cost-effective innovation cycles. Many companies spend millions of dollars on research and development, only to find themselves stuck in prolonged and inefficient trial-and-error processes. A curiosity-driven workplace, however, fosters a culture where questioning is valued, allowing organizations to make more informed decisions and refine their strategies before costly missteps occur. By leveraging to problem-solving, companies can optimize their investment in innovation and drive sustainable growth.

## How Companies Have Successfully Integrated Curiosity Into Their Culture
Many of the most successful companies in the world today have recognized that curiosity is an asset, not a liability. Firms like SurveyMonkey (now Momentive) have built their entire business model around curiosity—providing data-driven insights by encouraging users to ask better questions. The company’s former CEO, Zander Lurie, shared with me how curiosity wasn’t just a value at SurveyMonkey; it was the foundation of everything they did. “Powering the curious” wasn’t just a slogan—it was embedded into the company’s DNA, shaping product development, internal collaboration, and customer engagement. Lurie explained how they fostered a workplace where curiosity wasn’t just encouraged but operationalized, creating an environment where employees were expected to challenge assumptions, ask better questions, and seek constant improvement.
Rather than relying on outdated processes, SurveyMonkey actively solicited feedback from employees, customers, and stakeholders, using those insights to refine strategies and drive innovation. One striking example came when employees raised concerns about the benefits offered to contractors, prompting leadership to overhaul policies to ensure equal treatment—a change inspired entirely by curiosity-driven inquiry. By embracing curiosity at every level, SurveyMonkey demonstrated how an inquisitive culture isn’t just good for engagement—it’s a financial and ethical advantage that drives smarter decision-making and lasting success.
The link between curiosity and financial performance can be seen in many other companies that have made it a central pillar of their culture like Novartis. In their 2020 annual review Novartis showed an increase in employee learning hours from 35.8 in 2019 to 45.7 in 2020 under its '100 Hours of Learning' initiative. Increased participation in curiosity-driven programs correlated with higher engagement, which research links to improved productivity and profitability.
Another standout example is Atlassian, a company that has institutionalized curiosity-driven innovation through its ShipIt Days, where employees are given 24 hours to work on passion projects outside their usual scope of work. This initiative has directly contributed to product breakthroughs, including features that became integral to Atlassian’s core offerings.
According to the company's 2024 Annual Report, ShipIt has been instrumental in fostering cross-functional collaboration, improving efficiency, and driving customer satisfaction. Employees who participate in ShipIt report higher engagement levels, and Atlassian attributes part of its market leadership and sustained revenue growth to this culture of continuous innovation. In 2024, Atlassian reported total revenue of $4.4 billion, up 23% from the previous year. By recognizing that some of the best ideas emerge from unstructured exploration, Atlassian has built a workplace where curiosity fuels both creativity and financial success.
The highlights how highly curious employees drive greater innovation, adaptability, and financial performance. The report highlights that curiosity fuels business development and provides a competitive edge, as noted by Merck KGaA’s CEO, Dr. Stefan Oschmann. The research also establishes that companies fostering curiosity attract employees who are more engaged, creative, and resilient, which translates into stronger business outcomes. Additionally, findings indicate that curious employees contribute more actively to decision-making and problem-solving, reinforcing the notion that curiosity is a measurable driver of workplace success. This body of research underscores that organizations that strategically embed curiosity into their culture don’t just enhance employee satisfaction—they also experience direct financial gains by improving efficiency, reducing turnover, and fostering innovation.

The Organizational Barriers That Suppress Curiosity In The Workplace

## The Organizational Barriers That Suppress Curiosity In The Workplace
Despite its clear benefits, curiosity is often stifled within organizations due to entrenched corporate structures, leadership biases, and external pressures. Many companies unknowingly create environments that discourage intellectual exploration, leading employees to disengage from problem-solving and creative thinking. This suppression isn’t just a cultural issue—it has direct financial consequences. When curiosity is constrained, organizations lose out on potential innovations, struggle with retention, and remain vulnerable to market disruptions.
One of the most powerful is fear—the fear of asking the wrong question, fear of being perceived as incompetent, and fear of challenging authority. A study published by Harvard’s Amy Edmondson, found that psychological safety—the belief that one can speak up without fear of punishment—is a key driver of innovation. Yet, many workplaces inadvertently discourage questioning by prioritizing efficiency over exploration. In hierarchical organizations, employees often feel pressured to conform rather than challenge established processes, leading to a culture of silent compliance rather than active engagement. When employees hesitate to raise new ideas, the organization misses opportunities for growth and competitive advantage.
Another significant barrier is the failure to measure curiosity. Leaders often assume that curiosity occurs naturally, but without formal mechanisms to track and encourage it, curiosity often remains an untapped resource. Companies that fail to assess curiosity in hiring, leadership evaluations, or innovation metrics may unknowingly suppress it. A survey by PwC revealed that while 79% of CEOs believe innovation is a top priority, only 28% feel their organizations actively encourage employees to explore new ideas. The discrepancy between aspiration and execution highlights the structural challenges many companies face when trying to integrate curiosity into their business strategy.
Additionally, short-term performance pressures often stifle deep exploration. In many organizations, the need to meet quarterly earnings targets and operational benchmarks leads to a work culture that prioritizes immediate results over long-term innovation. Leaders who emphasize efficiency at the expense of curiosity create environments where employees avoid experimentation because it is perceived as too risky or time-consuming. This mindset is particularly detrimental in industries undergoing rapid transformation, where long-term adaptability is crucial for survival. Research from McKinsey & Company found that organizations that prioritize long-term thinking over short-term gains outperform their peers in revenue growth by 47%.
Even well-intentioned leaders can suppress curiosity by failing to provide the time and space for intellectual exploration. Studies show that employees who are given autonomy to pursue new ideas are more engaged and productive. Yet, in many companies, rigid schedules, overwhelming workloads, and constant deadlines leave little room for employees to explore creative solutions. Companies like Google, which famously implemented its 20% time policy allowing employees to spend a portion of their workweek on exploratory projects, demonstrate how structured curiosity can yield groundbreaking innovations. Products like Gmail and Google Maps emerged from this initiative, proving that curiosity, when given the right conditions, leads to tangible financial success.
Finally, technology can either enable or suppress curiosity, depending on how it is utilized. While digital tools have given employees access to an unprecedented amount of information, they can also create environments where employees rely too heavily on automation rather than deep thinking. A study by the _MIT Sloan Management Review_ found that leaders play a crucial role in fostering a learning culture that enhances employees' problem-solving abilities. Companies overly reliant on automated decision-making often experience a decline in critical thinking and problem-solving among employees. Instead of questioning data, employees accept algorithmic recommendations without fully exploring alternative solutions. Companies that fail to strike a balance between technology and human-driven inquiry risk becoming overly reliant on artificial intelligence and automation, inadvertently suppressing the curiosity that drives meaningful innovation.
The most successful companies recognize that curiosity must be deliberately nurtured, not left to chance. Overcoming these barriers requires intentional leadership, structured curiosity-building initiatives, and a willingness to prioritize exploration over short-term efficiency. Without these efforts, organizations risk becoming stagnant, losing talent, and falling behind in an increasingly competitive marketplace.

## How Leaders Can Build a Curiosity-Driven Organization
Curiosity does not thrive by accident—it must be deliberately embedded into the DNA of an organization through leadership behaviors, structured programs, and measurable incentives. Leaders who treat curiosity as a strategic priority, rather than an abstract ideal, unlock its full business potential. The first step is for leadership to model curiosity in their own actions. This means moving beyond the traditional top-down approach and demonstrating intellectual humility—openly admitting when they don’t have all the answers, encouraging employees to ask challenging questions, and rewarding those who take initiative to explore new ideas.
Beyond setting an example, leaders must institutionalize curiosity through formalized programs and initiatives. Companies that successfully foster curiosity invest in structured opportunities for exploration, such as innovation labs, think tanks, and cross-functional task forces where employees are encouraged to step outside their silos. Google isn’t the only company who has experimented with allowing employees time to experiment. Intuit holds “Design for Delight” workshops, where employees experiment with customer-driven innovations, leading to new product breakthroughs. These programs don’t just encourage creativity; they yield tangible financial results by tapping into employees' hidden potential.
Equally important is measuring and rewarding curiosity in meaningful ways. Too many organizations assume that curiosity is happening naturally, when in reality, bureaucratic roadblocks and performance pressures often stifle it. Leaders who embed curiosity into performance reviews, leadership assessments, and talent development frameworks create accountability and ensure that curiosity becomes a core competency rather than an afterthought. Companies like SAP have taken this approach by integrating curiosity assessments into their leadership training, demonstrating a clear link between curiosity-driven leadership and business success.
The most forward-thinking organizations recognize that curiosity must be embedded into corporate strategy, not just employee engagement initiatives. This means rethinking hiring practices to prioritize candidates who demonstrate curiosity, creating mentorship programs that pair employees with leaders outside their immediate disciplines, and designing incentive structures that reward those who take calculated risks and explore new ideas. When curiosity is treated as a measurable, high-impact business driver, organizations see greater adaptability, more resilient teams, and stronger financial performance.

The Future Of Curiosity In The Workplace

## The Future Of Curiosity In The Workplace
Curiosity is no longer a luxury or a “nice-to-have” trait—it is a competitive necessity. In an era defined by rapid change, market disruptions, and technological leaps, businesses that fail to cultivate curiosity will struggle to keep pace. The companies that thrive will be the ones that embed curiosity into their leadership philosophy, decision-making processes, and long-term strategies. It is no longer enough to praise curiosity in mission statements or acknowledge it in passing. Organizations must actively foster environments where questioning is encouraged, exploration is rewarded, and learning is continuous.
The financial case for curiosity is now undeniable. Organizations that prioritize it see stronger innovation pipelines, reduced operational inefficiencies, and greater employee engagement—key factors that translate directly to financial success. The challenge for leaders is not whether to embrace curiosity, but whether they will take meaningful action to integrate it into their corporate culture. Those who do will not just survive shifting market conditions—they will set the pace for the future. In a world where adaptability defines success, the organizations that champion curiosity will be the ones that lead. What specific steps are you taking to build curiosity into your leadership strategy today?

If you're aiming for work-balance balance, you might be surprised with this essential advice on how ... [+] to do that.
getty
Work-life balance has become a in 2025–even more than salary in some cases. But why does it feel so difficult to maintain? because no one agrees on what it means. There’s no consensus among experts on how to define work life-balance. Many consider the term “work-life balance” a dinosaur of the 1990s, calling it a myth and impossible to attain, and there is a movement afoot in this country to deconstruct it. But recently, two experts have made a cogent distinction.
## Work-Life Balance: What’s Out Of Whack?
Chances are your career goals are the same as most of your colleagues: to achieve and maintain a balanced, successful and stress-free work life. But the big question is how to get there. Achieving balance is sometimes a tight wire act because no one agrees what it means. What’s out of whack isn’t your work-life balance but the confusion on how to describe it.
Many interpret “work-life balance” to mean “perfect balance” or “equal balance” in which each quadrant (work, play, relationships and self) must be perfectly balanced. Major corporations have batted around the buzz phrase “work-life integration.” Jeff Bezos, for example, advised Amazon employees to stop aiming for work-life balance because it implies a trade off between the two.
PROMOTED
But what does “integration” mean? According to those who resist the term "integration," it implies 24/7 connectivity. Organizations that routinely provide free electronic devices to employees have been accused of sending the message that employees must be on call. And some critics have suggested that wireless devices force employees to stay connected to their jobs when they're trying to disconnect.
As the line between work and personal time continues to evaporate, especially with more employees working from home, both terms “work-life balance” and “work-life integration” have become old fashioned.
MORE FOR YOU
## How To Define Your Personal Work-Life Balance
Workplace psychologistsKatina Sawyer and Patricia Grabarek--authors of--have been studying workplace wellness for more than a decade.
According to Sawyer, “Work-life balance is one of the most talked-about workplace topics—but also one of the most misunderstood. Many people assume it means a perfect 50/50 split between work and personal life, but in reality, balance isn’t about the hours—it’s about how you feel.”
Now, the authors are setting the record straight. Through their research on workplace wellness and performance, they’ve identified four common misconceptions about work-life balance—and how to rethink the idea of balance for a healthier, more sustainable approach.
_1- Balance is defined by you._ Forget the rigid definitions; it’s about what _feels_ right for you, the authors contend. "One of the biggest mistakes people make is assuming there’s a one-size-fits-all formula for work-life balance," Grabarek explains. “That’s simply not true. Balance isn’t about rigid structures—it’s about what makes you feel in balance.”
She says a key understanding is whether you’re a _segmenter_ or an _integrator,_ describinga _s_ egmenter as a worker who prefers clear boundaries between work and personal life—clocking out at a set time, keeping work emails separate and mentally detaching from their job after hours.
In contrast, an integrator blends work and personal life, checking emails at night, taking personal calls during work hours and weaving both aspects of life together fluidly. “Neither approach is better—what matters is recognizing which category you fall into and designing your work-life balance accordingly,” Sawyer points out.
_2- Balance is ever-changing._ “Many workers assume that once they ‘figure out’ their work-life balance, they’re set for life,” Grabarek notes. “But in reality, balance is fluid.” She continues that balance that felt right when you were 22 and single may feel completely off when you’re 35 with three kids. “What worked when you were building your career might need to shift when you’re prioritizing personal well-being,” she states. “Even on a day-to-day level, balance might look different depending on deadlines, family needs or personal goals.”
Because of this, Sawyer argues, it’s critical to reassess what balance means for you—yearly, monthly or even weekly. “Employees should regularly reflect on what balance means for them and adjust accordingly," she says. "Employers should recognize that work-life balance isn’t static and allow employees to adjust their schedules and expectations as their needs evolve.”
3-_Achieving balance requires self-reflection._ The authors stress the importance of pinpointing what makes you feel balanced and prioritize it.Sawyer asserts that many employees feel frustrated with their work-life balance but don’t take the time to figure out why. She suggests that if you’re struggling, pause and reflect on the times you’ve felt most in sync and then work backward to build habits that support those moments. She shares three questions to guide you through the process:
  * Do you feel balanced when you leave work on time?
  * Does a morning workout set the tone for your day?
  * Do you need quiet time in the evening to recharge?


Sawyer mentions that if you’re a segmenter, you might feel most balanced when you fully disconnect from work after hours. But if you’re an integrator, trying to force those boundaries might feel restrictive rather than helpful.
4._Your balance isn’t someone else’s balance_. Sawyer emphasizes that there’s no right or wrong way to define balance—it’s entirely personal. An entrepreneur’s balance won’t look the same as a new dad’s, and that’s okay. “That’s why it’s critical not to make assumptions about what someone else needs—but to ask them directly.”
Grabarek agrees. “One of the most common mistakes people make is comparing their version of balance to someone else’s,” she adds. “A startup founder might thrive on long workweeks and high-intensity projects. A new dad might need to step back from work commitments to focus on family. A remote worker might find balance in asynchronous schedules, while an office worker needs clear work-life separation.”
## A Final Takeaway On Work-Life Balance
Grabarek suggests that you remember work-life balance isn’t about following a rigid set of rules. “It’s about figuring out what truly makes you feel energized, focused and fulfilled," she clarifies. "By defining balance on your own terms, reassessing it regularly and focusing on what works for you (not someone else), you can create a sustainable approach that supports both personal well-being and professional success.”
Grabarek declares how important it is for business leaders to understand when advocating for a positive team culture that there is no external ideal. And Sawyer underscores that employers should avoid cookie-cutter policies and offer flexible, adaptable approaches that respect individual needs.
“Our research also shows that when leaders protect their own boundaries, their team follows suit," Sawyer concludes. "Bosses are work-life balance role models, and if they don’t show employees they can maintain their own boundaries, employees will become boundary breakers themselves.”

Waking up hot is more than just a nighttime nuisance—frequent middle-of-the-night awakenings can lead to less shuteye and lower quality rest. As a hot sleeper myself, I worked with the mattress and sleep experts on our team along with a panel of testers to find the best cooling sheets for hot sleepers. After evaluating over a dozen different sets based on factors such as comfort, breathability and moisture wicking, we named the the best cooling sheet set overall. Its lightweight feel, quick dry time and ample breathability blew past the competition.
We tested a dozen of the best cooling sheets from Brooklinen, Sijo, Coyuchi and more.

## Best Cooling Sheets Overall
### Ultra-Soft With A Crisp Feel
Brooklinen
### Brooklinen Classic Percale Core Sheet Set (Queen)
$160.65$189Save $28.35 (15%)
**Material:** 100% long-staple cotton **|** **Weave:** Percale **|** **Thread count:** 270 **|** **Sizes:** Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California king **|** **Return window:** 365 days
**Best for:**
  * Those who want a traditional sheet feel that still regulates temperature
  * People who want a balance of crispness and softness


**Skip if:**
  * You’re looking for a sheet with a buttery-smooth feel


The Brooklinen Classic Percale Core Sheet Set proved to be the most popular cooling sheet set during testing; our tester found they became an instant favorite from the moment she slept with them. Our tester also notes how well the sheets wicked away moisture: “They stood out for their quick dry time and breathability.” Outside of passing our dry-time tests with flying colors, these sheets also shine in the softness department, thanks to their long-staple cotton and percale weave construction. This design (plus its 270 thread count) also strikes a nice balance between softness and crispness; in other words, the sheets feel lightweight and breathable despite the smooth, soft feel.
Senior mattress and sleep editor agrees: “These sheets are great for anyone wanting a , as I found them to be crisp, lightweight and soft. They’re more structured than the bamboo sheets on this list, but they’re still breathable and don’t trap body heat.” Our tester also liked that the “long” and “short” side labels simplify making the bed, so you don’t have to guess which end is which.
**Expert tip:** For an even crisper feel, our tester recommends letting these line dry instead of tumble drying.
## Best Budget Cooling Sheets
### Made Of 100% Bamboo Viscose
Puffy
### Puffy Signature Sheet Set
$179$210Save $31.00 (15%)
**Material:** 100% bamboo viscose **|** **Weave:** Sateen **|** **Thread count:** 300 **|** **Sizes:** Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California king **|** **Return window:** 101 days
**Best for:**
  * Those with extra-thick mattresses (these sheets fit up to 15-inch thick beds)
  * People who prefer a silky-soft feel to their sheets that still sleeps cool


**Skip if:**
  * You like a crisper feel to your sheets
  * You want more color choices than gray and white


Whether you’re on a tight budget or not, Puffy’s Signature Sheet Set deserves serious consideration in your bedding lineup. Its low price tag coupled with a high-quality bamboo viscose design makes this option a great value. “I often recommend them to friends who are looking for quality sheets at a more affordable price,” says Chapman. She says these sheets feel more silky soft than the if you compare them side-by-side, but the set doesn’t skimp on breathability, thanks to its 100% viscose (from bamboo) construction.
“These were my main sheets for a while because they’re super comfortable, soft and breathable,” adds Chapman. “Here’s a direct quote from the last friend I recommended them to: ‘Omg, 10 out of 10 for these sheets... It’s so hard to know what the quality and softness will actually be from shopping online—these are perfect.’”
**Expert tip:** Machine wash the sheets in cold water and tumble dry low in order to maintain their quality and softness.
## Most Soft Cooling Sheets
### Luxuriously Soft, Yet Still Breathable
Cozy Earth
### Cozy Earth Bamboo Sheet Set (Queen)
$264.80$331Save $66.20 (20%)
**Material:** 100% bamboo viscose **|** **Weave:** Sateen **|** **Thread count:** 300 **|** **Sizes:** Twin/twin XL, full, queen, king, split king, California king **|** **Return window:** 100 days
**Best for:**
  * People who prefer a buttery-soft feel
  * Those with a thicker mattress (these sheets can accommodate up to 20-inch thick beds)


**Skip if:**
  * You want a thicker, crisper feel to your sheets


All of the sheets on this list are soft, but none compare to the buttery softness we experienced with the Cozy Earth Bamboo Sheet Set. Our tester found these sheets to feel extremely smooth and cozy, without feeling too slick. Similar to the , these sheets are made from 100% viscose from bamboo, a material that helps regulate body temperature. However, unlike the Puffy sheets, the Cozy Earth set comes with a slightly higher thread count (equating to a more luxurious feel) and a 10-year warranty, should your set pill or break down in the wash over time.
Chapman shares these are her go-to for hot nights. “These sheets have been in my regular rotation for years now. They truly are buttery soft—and that softness doesn’t fade over time. They’re also super lightweight and flowy, which makes them extremely breathable and great for hot sleepers or toasty summer nights.” Our only issue with these sheets is some subtle transparency, which is largely due to the lightweight feel. “If you pick the white color, they are a little see-through, which is really only noticeable if you have a pillow with dark colors on it,” says Chapman.
**Expert tip:** To minimize wrinkles, our tester suggests removing these immediately from the dryer and putting them on your bed.
## Most Lightweight Cooling Sheets
### Silky-Soft Feel That Doesn't Pill
Sijo
### Sijo Airyweight Eucalyptus Sheet Set (Queen)
$157.25$185Save $27.75 (15%)
**Material:** 100% Tencel lyocell from eucalyptus **|** **Weave:** Sateen **|** **Thread count:** 300 **|** **Sizes:** Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California king **|** **Return window:** 7 days
**Best for:**
  * Those who prefer a silky-smooth feel 
  * Sleepers with allergies
  * Hot sleepers who sweat at night


**Skip if:**
  * You like a crisp, more substantial feel to your sheets


If you’re looking for an airy, more delicate feel to your sheets, we recommend checking out the Sijo Airyweight Eucalyptus Sheet Set. At 130 GSM (grams per square meter), these sheets are as lightweight and silky smooth as they come. They’re made from Lyocell fibers and treated with an antimicrobial silver-ion, which according to Sijo, helps slow the spread of microorganisms like bacteria and fungi—a major bonus for people with night sweats or those who can’t be bothered to wash their sheets on a weekly basis (guilty). Plus, the natural moisture-wicking properties from the Lyocell material help keep the sheets cool to the touch and ultra breathable.
**Expert tip:** Our tester suggests washing these separately or with like fabrics to help prevent pilling or snags.
## Best Bamboo Cooling Sheets
### Beat The Heat With These Silky-Smooth Sheets
Quince
### Quince Bamboo Sheet Set (Queen)
$129.90$289Save $159.10 (55%)
**Material:** 100% viscose from organic bamboo **|** **Weave:** Sateen **|** **Thread count:** 300 **|** **Sizes:** Twin, full, queen, king, California king **|** **Return window:** 365 days
**Best for:**
  * Those who like a silky-smooth feel 
  * Those looking for a great value for viscose bamboo sheets
  * Those wanting the option to forgo a flat sheet


**Skip if:**
  * You prefer a crisp feel


This may be the third bamboo set on our list—bamboo _is_ one of the best cooling materials—but there’s a reason the Quince Bamboo Set in particular tops our list of the . Similar to the Puffy Signature Set and the Cozy Earth Bamboo set, the Quince sheets have a sateen weave, which gives them a subtle sheen. However, unlike the Puffy and Cozy Earth sheets, they are made with 100% viscose from _organic_ bamboo, which makes these sheets naturally hypoallergenic and a good fit for sleepers with allergies or sensitive skin. Our tester loved their silky-soft feel and was impressed by their cooling prowess.
**Expert tip:** Our tester recommends choosing the fitted sheet set (which doesn’t come with a flat sheet) and pairing it with a cooling duvet for the same feel without the extra sheet layer.
## Best Tencel Cooling Sheets
### A Cool-To-The-Touch Sensation That Lasts
Slumber Cloud
### Slumber Cloud Performance Sheet Set (Queen)
$215.10$239Save $23.90 (10%)
**Material:** 40% viscose, 60% Tencel lyocell **|** **Weave:** N/A **|** **Thread count:** 300 **|** **Sizes:** Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California king **|** **Return window:** 60 days
**Best for:**
  * Those who want sheets that feel cool to the touch
  * Extra-hot sleepers in need of enhanced temperature regulation
  * Those who prefer a loose drape and minimal cling


**Skip if:**
  * You want to choose from a wide variety of vibrant colors or patterns


For hot sleepers looking for immediate relief, the Slumber Cloud Performance Sheet Set is our top recommendation. Its dual temperature-regulating design is specifically made to address excess heat; first, the Outlast technology that’s incorporated into the material gives it a cool-to-the-touch sensation, followed by a combination of viscose and Tencel lyocell, which helps regulate your body temperature. The result is an exceptionally cool feel, plus the helps the sheets grow softer with each wash. Our tester also found these sheets as aren’t clingy as other sheets that tend to stick to your body—a pro for sleepers who prefer a lightweight feel.
**Expert tip:** Our tester stresses the importance of following the care instructions to maintain the cooling effect and longevity.
## Best Organic Cooling Sheets
### Similar Feel As A Freshly Ironed Button-Down Shirt
Coyuchi
### Coyuchi Organic Percale Sheet Set (Queen)
$278
**Material:** 100% organic cotton **|** **Weave:** Percale **|** **Thread count:** 300 **|** **Sizes:** Twin, full, queen, king, California king **|** **Return window:** 180 days
**Best for:**
  * You prefer a “just ironed” feel to your sheets
  * Year-round use
  * Those who appreciate stylish touches


**Skip if:**
  * You prefer a thinner, lighter-weight sheet


The Coyuchi Organic Percale Sheet Set is made from 100% GOTS-certified organic cotton; beyond providing a cleaner, toxin-free sleep experience, organic cotton also naturally sleeps cool. Coupled with the percale weave, these sheets have a more substantial, crisp feel that our tester found feels similar to a freshly ironed shirt. Our tester also found these have a more substantial feel than the Brooklinen Percale Sheets, making them better for hot sleepers who want a bit more sheet in the winter.
We also like the thoughtful design touches, which include an extra-wide, 7-inch hem at the top of the flat sheet that matches the detailing on the pillowcases—both of which give the set an elevated, sleeker look when peeking out from a blanket or duvet cover.
**Expert tip:** Our tester suggests putting these sheets on the bed straight from the dryer to minimize wrinkling.
## Best Linen Cooling Sheets
### Linen Sheets That Aren’t Scratchy
Bed Threads

  * Hot sleepers who sweat at night
  * People who want to choose from a wide variety of colors


**Skip if:**
  * You’re on a tight budget


While can get a lot of flack for feeling rough or scratchy, this option from Bed Threads is the exact opposite. Our tester found they feel soft to the touch; mattress editor agrees: “I was hesitant to try linen sheets until I bought the Bed Threads Flax Linen pair and now they're my go-to bedding. They manage to be buttery soft, airy and durable at the same time, and they've only become softer.”
Our tester also found these sheets excelled at wicking away moisture and drying quickly. And similar to other linen sheets, these have more of a laidback, lived-in look. One note: While the sheets are technically machine washable, Bed Threads recommends you don’t tumble dry (or if you do, avoid using a hot setting).
**Expert tip:** Our tester recommends washing and drying these a few times immediately after unboxing to get rid of excess lint and increase softness.

## Honorable Mention
  * **:** Our tester enjoyed the Buffy hemp linen sheets for their soft, smooth feel. However, she found they didn’t quite beat out the in the moisture-wicking and quick-drying department. We do like that they are less expensive than the Bed Threads set, though, so if you’re looking for cooling linen sheets that are also budget-friendly, these are still a solid pick.

## How We Tested The Best Cooling Sheets
To compile a list of contenders for the best cooling sheets, we started by identifying top-rated bedding brands. Then, we considered each brand’s suite of sheet offerings, looking for sets made with cooling materials such as bamboo, Tencel and organic cotton. Once we had a list of about a dozen contenders, we began our testing.
Our tester slept on each sheet set for at least two nights to assess its comfort and overall experience, paying close attention to factors like cooling, breathability and others. She also performed a series of tests to evaluate each set’s moisture-wicking abilities and overall durability; these include: placing the same amount of water on each sheet and measuring how far the water spread, timing how long it took the water to dry on the sheet and washing and drying each sheet set three times to evaluate the level of pilling.
We also weighed each set’s price tag against the overall value offered, noting whether any sheet sets seemed overly expensive (based on their performance during testing) or a particularly great deal.
## What To Consider When Buying The Best Cooling Sheets
With so many varying factors, from material and weave to and price, no two sets of cooling sheets are alike. We break down each of these factors and how they affect the overall feel and cooling ability of a sheet set, below.
### Material
The material cooling sheets are made from is the biggest determining factor in just how cool the sheets feel and sleep. We outlined the most common cooling materials below, including who each material is best suited for.
  * **Cotton:** Cotton is one of the most popular fibers in sheets due to its softness and breathability. Cotton typically has a percale or sateen weave. We go more in-depth on weave below, but as a general rule of thumb, a is best for someone who’s looking for a sheet that’s very breathable and crisp to the touch (think freshly-ironed shirt crisp). A is not as crisp or light as percale, but some may prefer the softer feel and slight sheen of this weave.
  * **Lyocell and viscose:** Lyocell and viscose help regulate body temperature and wick away moisture. Some sheets made with this material may also have a slight cool-to-the-touch feel. These are great options for someone who wants a silky-smooth, more lightweight sheet.
  * **Tencel:** Tencel is not a fiber type or material, but rather a trademarked brand of lyocell. Tencel also has a brand of modal fibers, but it’s not typically seen in sheets.
  * **Linen:** Linen helps move moisture away from the body and dissipate heat, which makes it a popular choice for summer clothing. On the flip side, linen can feel scratchy if it’s not high quality. If you sweat profusely at night, a high-quality linen set may be a good option for you since it works to move moisture away from the body and dry quickly.
  * **Silk:** Silk sheets feel sleek and have natural thermoregulating properties, which is why they are also a popular material for cooling pajamas. However, silk sheets do often come with a higher price tag, and most require extra care like a special silk detergent and delicate cycles, so those who don’t want the extra hassle (or cost) may want to skip these.
  * **Bamboo:** Sheets that are marketed as “bamboo” are usually lyocell, rayon or viscose, which are fibers that are derived from bamboo but go through a manufacturing process to turn it into fabric. The highest-quality type of bamboo is viscose derived from 100% organic bamboo. Bamboo sheets are known for feeling buttery soft yet still breathable, making the material a popular choice for cooling sheets.


### Weave
While the type of material your sheets are made from is a crucial component for cooler rest, the type of weave also plays a role in how breathable or heavy your sheets feel. Generally speaking, a percale weave tends to sleep the coolest; its one-under, one-over structure leaves more room for air to flow. Sheets made with a percale weave also have a more crisp, lightweight feel.
Another popular weave style is sateen, which can sleep warmer than percale if the sheets are also of a higher thread count. While a sateen sheet feels more substantial than a percale due to its denser weave style, it’s typically still a good choice for hot sleepers as it drapes over your body, instead of clinging to your skin.
### **Thread Count**
As a general rule of thumb, hot sleepers should look for sheets with a lower thread count (think 300 or less), which allows more heat and moisture to escape. A higher thread count typically feels heavier, thicker and overall warmer. Note: A doesn’t necessarily mean a higher-quality sheet; instead, thread count is an indication of the thickness of the sheet and its ability to keep you cool or warm.
## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
### **Do Cooling Sheets Really Work?**
Yes, cooling sheets work, but it’s important to remember they aren’t the end-all-be-all solution to cooler rest. Other factors like the temperature in your home, whether you sleep with a partner and even the type of pajamas you wear all play a role in deciding how warm or cool you sleep.
### **What Are The Best Sheets To Keep You Cool?**
After testing a dozen different options, we found the are the best sheets for keeping you cool. The percale weave combined with the long-staple cotton construction creates a breathable, lightweight feel that also excels at wicking away moisture.
### **Are Bamboo Sheets Cooler Than Cotton?**
Most of the time bamboo sheets do usually sleep cooler than cotton. Bamboo sheets are typically more lightweight and drape over your body more than cotton does. However, other factors like weave and thread count play a role, too, so if you compare bamboo sheets with a higher thread count to cotton sheets with a lower thread count (and a naturally cooler weave like percale), the cotton sheets will likely sleep cooler.

Building passive revenue is a strategy that allows your business to make money without you ... [+] constantly working for it.

Imagine waking up, checking your bank account, and seeing an extra $500, $1,000, or even $10,000 that came in overnight, without lifting a finger. Sounds too good to be true? It’s not. Wealthy people build passive revenue all the time, and today, I’ll show you how you can do it too.
Passive revenue is a strategy that allows your business to make money without you constantly working for it. If you’re a business owner or entrepreneur, adding passive revenue streams is one of the smartest moves you can make. Not only does it boost your income, but it also increases the value of your business if you ever decide to sell it.
In this article, I’ll break down:
  * The importance of passive revenue for financial freedom and business valuation
  * How the rich build wealth using passive income
  * How to add an extra $100,000 per year in passive revenue
  * The top five passive revenue ideas for 2025


## What is passive revenue and why is it so important?
Let’s clear something up. Passive revenue doesn’t mean doing nothing—it means doing the work once and getting paid over and over again.
PROMOTED
Think about writing a book, selling an online course, renting out property, or investing in dividend stocks. You put in the effort upfront, and the money keeps flowing in without trading your time for it. This is what separates the truly wealthy from those stuck in the grind forever.
MORE FOR YOU
But here’s the biggest advantage that most business owners overlook: A business with passive revenue is significantly more valuable if you ever decide to sell.
Why? Buyers want businesses that are profitable, scalable, and not dependent on the owner. Passive revenue streams increase profitability, reduce owner dependency, and create predictable, recurring income. Buyers pay more for businesses with steady, predictable revenue. If you ever want to exit your business for life-changing money, focusing on passive revenue is one of the smartest financial moves you can make.

## How do rich people build wealth?
Wealthy individuals don’t rely on one income stream. They have multiple sources of income, and most of them don’t require daily effort.
Here’s what they do differently:
  * They buy assets, not liabilities. Instead of buying expensive cars, they invest in real estate, stocks, or businesses that generate income.
  * They focus on compounding income. They reinvest profits into income-producing assets instead of spending everything they make.
  * They build systems that make money. Every wealthy person has revenue streams that don’t need them to be present every single day.


The good news? You don’t need to be a millionaire to start building passive revenue. You just need to set up the right systems.
## How to add $100,000 a year in passive revenue as a business owner
Earning an extra $100,000 per year in passive revenue isn’t some far-fetched dream. It’s more like a math problem. Break it down, and it’s surprisingly achievable.
Here’s how:
  * Sell 275 digital products a year at $365 each (that’s less than one per day)
  * Get 200 members into a $42 per month membership community
  * Earn $8,333 per month in affiliate marketing commissions
  * Rent out a property or asset your business owns to generate $2,000 per month in passive income


The beauty of these strategies? They don’t just make you extra money, they also increase your business’s valuation. When you build multiple passive revenue streams into your business, business buyers see higher profits, lower risks, and greater scalability—all of which translate into a higher sale price.
## What are the five best passive revenue ideas in 2025?
### 1. Selling digital products and online courses
One of the fastest ways to generate passive revenue. You make it once, and it sells forever.
Examples:
  * E-books, guides, or templates
  * Online courses and masterclasses
  * Subscription-based paid content like exclusive newsletters


### 2. Subscription-based membership communities
Want recurring revenue every single month? A membership community gives stable recurring revenue—so you don’t start at zero each month.
Examples:
  * Paid private Slack or Facebook groups
  * Monthly coaching or consulting memberships
  * Exclusive content, like a stock-picking or trend-spotting newsletter


### 3. Affiliate marketing (get paid for recommending products)
You don’t need to create your own products to make build wealth. Affiliate marketing lets you earn commissions by promoting other people’s products.
Examples:
  * Software tools for business owners like ClickFunnels, ActiveCampaign, and Kajabi
  * Books, courses, or premium newsletters created by others
  * Physical products through Amazon, ShareASale, or Impact


### 4. Real estate investing and Airbnb rentals
Real estate is one of the best long-term wealth-building businesses and you don’t need millions to start.
Examples:
  * Airbnb rentals (even just one room or apartment)
  * Buying rental properties for steady cash flow
  * REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) for passive investing
  * Rent out parts of your office or warehouse you are not using


### 5. Monetizing video content (YouTube, Reels,…)
Want to get paid for creating content? Video monetization is booming—and you don’t need millions of followers to cash in.
Examples:
  * YouTube ad revenue and sponsorships
  * Instagram Reels with digital product sales


## Final thoughts: Start building passive revenue today
Building passive revenue won’t make you rich overnight, but it will make you rich over time. In a year, you’ll be earning while you sleep, growing your wealth like the rich do, and finally breaking free from the cycle of trading time for money. And if you ever want to sell your business for life-changing money, the best way to do it is by stacking passive revenue streams that increase profitability, reduce owner dependency, and attract high-value buyers.

Costco on Thursday reported another sturdy — if mixed — quarter, demonstrating that its focus on keeping prices low continues to bring more shoppers to its stores at an uncertain time for the U.S. economy. Total revenue in its second quarter of fiscal year 2025 rose 9% year over year to $63.72 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of $63.13 billion, according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Earnings per share (EPS) in the 12 weeks ended Feb. 16 came in at $4.02, missing the consensus of $4.11, LSEG data showed. The reported figure includes a 13-cent hit from foreign exchange rates, a common theme this earnings season among multinational companies dealing with a strong U.S. dollar. EPS rose 2.6% on an annual basis, though the year-ago period included a $94 million tax benefit. Without it, EPS would’ve been up 8.4%. Costco Why we own it: Costco is the best-run retailer in the world, with a business model focused on offering its members a relatively small universe of products at hard-to-beat prices. Costco has succeeded for decades, but the high inflation of recent years has made the company’s value-focused ethos really shine. Competitors: BJ’s Wholesale , Walmart , fellow Club holding Amazon Last buy: June 15, 2020 Initiation date: Jan. 27, 2020 Bottom line Costco did not report its prettiest quarter, but a Picasso is still a Picasso. Nothing in the numbers or what was said on Thursday’s conference call suggests the best-of-breed retailer has lost a step in both its operations and its appeal to customers who want more bang for the buck and a fun shopping experience. The EPS miss is hardly a back-breaker. Operating margins still expanded on a year-over-year basis for the eighth quarter in a row, albeit at a slightly lower pace than Wall Street expected, and its top-line grew at a hearty 9% clip. Same store sales — often called comparable store sales, or comps — also exceeded expectations during the important holiday quarter. Membership renewal rates also creeped up compared with the first quarter. Shares of Costco were down a little more than 1% in extended trading Thursday. The muted move after earnings is far from unusual with Costco because the company reports sales on a monthly basis, meaning often a lot of the good news is priced into the stock. Indeed, Costco shares were up nearly 4% since its last earnings on Dec. 12 report versus a 5.2% decline in the S & P 500 . COST 1Y mountain Costco’s stock performance over the past 12 months. Costco’s earnings arrive at a time of growing concern on Wall Street about the health of the U.S. economy and the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariff policy on prices and consumer spending. On the earnings call, CFO Gary Millerchip said Costco was not really seeing any change in member behavior compared with the prior few quarters. Members are showing a willingness to spend, but they’re just being choosy about what they spend their money on, he said. That dynamic could be even more pronounced if there’s a return of inflation and “the potential impact of tariffs could flow through as well,” Millerchip said. Costco’s merchants try to lean into a choosier consumer by bringing in new and exciting products at attractive prices, he said. For example, he noted that sales of 98-inch and 100-inch TVs, Stern pinball machines and gaming computers were strong during the holiday season. Overall, nonfood categories led the way for Costco’s sales growth in the mid-teens on a comparable basis in the quarter. Fresh foods were up high single digits, he said, noting that spending shifts toward lower-cost meats continued. On tariffs specifically, CEO Ron Vachris said Costco can work through the impact in multiple ways, which was reassuring to hear. With Costco’s emphasis on a “treasure hunt” shopping experience, Vachris said the company can be flexible with what it sells and, if necessary, replace heavily tariffed products with something else that is less exposed. For items that can’t avoid tariffs, such as fresh foods and other grocery items, Vachris offered up a classic Costco refrain: “When it rains, it rains on everyone.” He added, “Our people are very well equipped to lower prices and defer any cost increase that comes our way.” The great irony in owning Costco is that its stock is not cheap, especially now at nearly 55 times forward earnings estimates. But when it comes to stock-picking, quality often carries a premium. For now, we’re reiterating our 2 rating , meaning we’ll wait for a pullback before buying more, and price target of $1,100 a share. Commentary Total comparable sales, an important retail industry metric, rose a better-than-expected 6.8% in the quarter, driven by a 5.7% increase in traffic, or shopping frequency, and a 1% increase in ticket. We like to see the gains being led by traffic because it signals that more people are visiting Costco’s warehouses, which bodes well for continued market share gains versus retail peers. Excluding the impact of gas price changes and foreign exchange, Costco saw a 9.1% increase in comps. Comparable e-commerce sales, a growing focus for the company and investors, were up 20.9% in the quarter, or 22.2% when excluding foreign exchange. The growth rate is up significantly from the 13% clip (13.2% in constant currency) observed in the first quarter. It’s slightly faster than what was observed in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024. Another growth initiative is its advertising business, known as “retail media.” After completing its first targeted media campaign last quarter, Millerchip said Costco now has entered into roughly 10 similar programs with partners and “see a lot more in the pipeline.” The finance chief said Costco’s plan is to use that revenue stream to reinvest in the business and keep prices low, which is good for keeping paying members around. Its worldwide renewal rate was 90.5% and 93% in the U.S. and Canada, up from 90.4% and 92.8% in the prior quarter. It was nice to see the modest increase because executives have cautioned investors that an increase in digital sign-ups, which tend to renew at a lower rate, will impact its retention rate for the fiscal year. Store openings in Asia also can affect the result here, Millerchip said, because they generate outsized membership sign-ups, but also have lower renewal rates. Still, the overall number of paid memberships continued to trend higher, to 78.4 million at the end of the quarter, up 6.8% year over year. That was 300,000 below Wall Street expectations. Costco opened just one warehouse in the second quarter, but it has a few planned openings in the coming weeks, including its 900th location worldwide in Sharon, Massachusetts, which is roughly equidistant from Boston and Providence, Rhode Island. One of the Wall Street analysts on the call said he’s a lifelong resident of the town, and the “buzz is high” among people in the community. Of course, that’s just anecdotal evidence, but it goes to show the kind of enduring appeal that Costco has among shoppers at a time where Wall Street is closely tracking the company’s expansion trajectory. New stores both in the U.S. and abroad represent opportunities to add members and grow sales further. Costco estimates it will end the year with 915 stores, 25 more than at the end of fiscal 2024. That is down slightly from the 916 store estimate provided alongside earnings in December. (Jim Cramer’s Charitable Trust is long COST. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

Struggling drugstore chain is going private. 
The company on Thursday said it with private equity firm Sycamore Partners that will take it off the public market for an equity value of around $10 billion.
Sycamore will pay $11.45 per share in cash for Walgreens, representing a roughly 8% premium to the stock's closing price on Thursday. Shareholders could also receive up to $3 more per share in the future from sales of Walgreens' primary-care businesses, including Village Medical, Summit Health and CityMD. 
Walgreens said the total value of the transaction would be up to $23.7 billion when including debt and possible payouts down the line.
Walgreens and Sycamore expect to close the take-private deal in the fourth quarter of this year. Shares of Walgreens jumped more than 5% in after-hours trading on Thursday before being halted.
The historic deal ends Walgreens' tumultuous run as a public company, which began in 1927. As of Thursday morning, shares of the company were up more than 15% for 2025, but the stock was still down more than 48% for the last year and had fallen 70% for the past three years. 
"While we are making progress against our ambitious turnaround strategy, meaningful value creation will take time, focus and change that is better managed as a private company," Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth, who stepped into the role in 2023, said in a release on Thursday. "Sycamore will provide us with the expertise and experience of a partner with a strong track record of successful retail turnarounds.
Stefan Kaluzny, Sycamore's managing director, said in the release the transaction reflects the firm's confidence in Walgreens' "pharmacy-led model and essential role in driving better outcomes for patients, customers and communities."
Walgreens will maintain its headquarters in Chicago. The company currently has more than 310,000 employees globally and 12,500 retail pharmacy locations across the U.S., Europe and Latin America, according to the release. Walgreens still plans to release its second-quarter earnings on April 8.
Walgreens's market value reached a peak of more than $100 billion in 2015 as investors gained confidence in its health-care business and expansion plans, making it one of the most prominent American retail companies. 
But the company's market cap shrank to under $8 billion in late 2024 due to competition from its main rival CVS, grocery chains, big-box retailers and, along with a slew of challenges. Walgreens has been squeezed by the transition out of the Covid pandemic, pharmacy reimbursement headwinds, softer consumer spending and a troubled push into health care.
Both Walgreens and CVS have pivoted from years of store expansions to shuttering hundreds of retail pharmacy locations across the U.S. to shore up profits. But unlike CVS, which has diversified its business model by offering insurance and pharmacy benefits, Walgreens largely doubled down on its now-flailing retail pharmacy business. 
In October, Walgreens said it plans to over the next three years, including 500 in fiscal 2025 alone. Walgreens has around 8,700 locations in the U.S., a quarter of which it says are unprofitable. The company has also scaled back its push into primary care by cutting its stake in provider VillageMD. 
Walgreens tapped health-care industry veteran Tim Wentworth as its new CEO in late 2023 to help regain its footing. 
The company has reportedly been seen as a potential private equity target in the past. 
In 2019, private equity firm KKR made a roughly offer to Walgreens, the Financial Times and Bloomberg reported at the time.
