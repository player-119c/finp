MSFT Stock
TrefisTrefis
stock experienced a decline of over 3% on Monday, March 10, amid a broader Wall Street downturn. This sell-off was triggered by mounting concerns over President Donald Trump’s tariff policy and its wider impact on the economy.

At its current levels of $380, MSFT stock looks **_attractive but volatile_** - making it a **tricky pick** to buy. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with MSFT stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is very high. Separately, with earnings due this week, see We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of MSFT stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Microsoft along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a **very strong** operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below.

Beware this highly sophisticated Microsoft 365 attack.
SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images
Sometimes it can feel like Microsoft users are on the sharp end of the cybersecurity stick a little too often. Be that by way of multiple zero-day vulnerabilities , or Microsoft Account takeovers that . Microsoft 365 users, however, could certainly be excused for feeling hard done by in the attack stakes with hackers exploiting technical gaps to manipulate URLs, or basic authentication exploitation by password campaigns. Now, Microsoft 365 users have been warned as a new and sophisticated attack bypasses traditional email security controls by embedding phishing lures within legitimate Microsoft communications. Here’s what you need to know.
## New Phishing Attack Uses Microsoft-Signed Emails
What researchers have called a highly sophisticated phishing campaign that exploits Microsoft 365 trusted infrastructure to facilitate account takeover attempts through credential harvesting techniques, has been confirmed. By exploiting legitimate Microsoft domains and misconfigurations within tenants, the threat actors are executing Business Email Compromise attacks which are capable of maintaining a very convincing appearance of legitimacy. This method bypasses conventional email security measures, the researchers have revealed, by capitalizing on and exploiting inherent trust mechanisms.
PROMOTED
In a March 13 report, Ron Lev, a security researcher at Guardz Research, explained that as e-mail defenses such as secure email gateways continue to evolve, so attackers are finding they need to refine their evasion techniques to bypass these more robust protections.
This latest analysis shows how the threat actors in this campaign have manipulated Microsoft 365 tenant properties, abused tenant architectures and leveraged organizational profile spoofing “to embed phishing payloads directly within enterprise environments,” according to Lev.
MORE FOR YOU
## New Attack Avoids Email Spoofing And Operates Entirely Within Microsoft’s Ecosystem
The main thrust of this latest Microsoft 365 attack is the exploitation of totally legitimate Microsoft services in order to establish a trusted delivery route for the payload. By so doing, it makes it difficult for technical controls and human recipients alike to detect. “Unlike traditional phishing, which relies on lookalike domains or email spoofing,” Lev said, “this method operates entirely within Microsoft’s ecosystem, bypassing security measures and user skepticism by leveraging native Microsoft 365 infrastructure to deliver phishing lures that appear authentic and blend in seamlessly.”
In particular, the use of trusted Microsoft service-generated emails enables traditional security measures such as domain reputation analysis, as well as anti-spoofing mechanisms to be bypassed. “The result is a highly deceptive attack that exploits inherent trust in Microsoft’s cloud services,” Lev warned, “making it significantly more challenging for security teams to detect and mitigate.”
Indeed, as Lev pointed out, the leveraging of Microsoft’s legitimate email infrastructure means that the phishing email can pass through Microsoft’s servers without raising any security alerts. What’s more, as it originates from such a trusted source, it is also far less likely to be flagged by security tools as it makes its way to the victim’s inbox. I recommend reading the for all the technical details.
## Mitigating the Microsoft 365 Email Attack Chain
I have reached out to Microsoft for a statement, but in the meantime, while Lev admitted that this latest attack presents a number of challenges for defenders, not least the lack of protections from traditional email security measures and the use of legitimate Microsoft domains, mitigations are not only possible but highly recommended.
  * Train users with phishing awareness to recognize suspicious elements.
  * Be suspicious of communications from unfamiliar .onmicrosoft.com domains and newly created Microsoft 365 tenants.
  * Implement email content inspection that analyzes organization fields and metadata and check return-path headers.

The last posting on March 6 analyzed the prospects for four of the Magnificent Seven or the “Fab” Seven as some commentators have renamed the group. Let us apply the same approach to Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), and Tesla. (I added Netflix in the first posting, so we are analyzing the big eight.) The overall stock market is projected to be in a trading range this year. Cycles will be a useful guide in trading the tech heavyweights in 2025.
As we can see below, the Amazon cycle bottoms now. This cycle is synchronized with the Amazon seasonal cycle. From March 3 through July 5, this stock has risen over 80% of the time over the last 27 years. This stock is likely to outperform the technology index.
## Amazon Monthly Cycle

This cycle points to a low now.
Cycles Research Investments LLC
PROMOTED
Microsoft cycles are strong until June, but underperformance is likely in the second half of the year. The first half of any year has been bullish. Over the last 38 years, the stock has risen 74% of the time. The cycle is the weakest of the stocks that are under review in the second half of 2025, projecting a weak close to 2025.

This cycle advises us to sell in May. 
Cycles Research Investments LLC
MORE FOR YOU
The Alphabet monthly rhythm is different from that of most of the other stocks. It traces out a 2025 trading range. There is a low in May followed by a July peak. There is a late October low followed by a strong Q4. Trade the stock.
## Alphabet Monthly Cycle

This stock is in a 2025 trading range.
Cycles Research Investments LLC
Tesla peaked before the overall technology stock decline. The stock followed its cycle down. The cycle falls into early June and then rallies for most of the rest of the year. June has been the single strongest month in any year, so the dynamic cycle low is reinforced by the low in the seasonal cycle.

Malvertising - phone hack and attack method concept. Cyber criminal hacker using laptop and ... [+] smartphone with glitch effect
getty
Microsoft Threat Intelligence recently provided an analysis of a that compromised nearly one million devices globally.
This attack, originating from illegal streaming websites, highlights the increasing sophistication and reach of cyber threats targeting consumers and businesses alike. The campaign, which was tracked as Storm-0408, used malicious advertisements embedded within movie frames to redirect users through multiple layers to malware hosted on GitHub and other platforms.
The attack appeared deceptively simple at first. Users seeking free access to movies on illegal streaming sites unwittingly initiated a complex chain of events. Rather than simple pop-up advertisements, the attackers embedded malicious code directly into the video streams themselves. This meant that as a user watched a film, hidden ads were silently working in the background, initiating a series of redirections.
PROMOTED
These redirections, sometimes four or five in number, were designed to obfuscate the attack's origin, making it incredibly difficult to trace. Users, unaware of the behind-the-scenes activity, were led through a digital maze, ultimately landing on sites that hosted malicious software. Notably, these malware-hosting sites included platforms like GitHub, which are typically considered trustworthy, allowing the attackers to exploit user confidence.
Once the malware was downloaded, its primary objective was information theft. It began by gathering system information effectively taking a digital inventory of the compromised device. This was followed by the deployment of additional malware designed to steal sensitive data such as passwords, credit card details, documents, and browsing history.
MORE FOR YOU
This layered approach allowed the attackers to establish a persistent presence, maximizing their potential for data exfiltration. The impact was widespread, affecting not only individual consumers but also potentially compromising devices within business networks.
## Relevant Cybersecurity Issues
This cybercrime operation underscores several critical security issues:
  * **Wide-Reaching Malvertising Campaigns**


The use of malicious advertisements to spread is a growing threat. Malvertising campaigns are often indiscriminate, affecting both individual consumers and large organizations across various industries.
  * **Redirection Techniques**


The campaign's use of multiple redirections to reach the final malware payload highlights the sophistication of modern cyberattacks. These techniques are designed to evade detection and make it harder to trace the source of the attack.
  * **Information Stealers**


The ultimate goal of the campaign was to steal sensitive information from the compromised devices. This type of malware can have devastating consequences for individuals, leading to financial loss, , and other serious issues.
  * **Exploitation of Trusted Platforms**


Attackers are increasingly leveraging trusted platforms like GitHub, Dropbox, and Discord to host and distribute malware. By abusing these platforms' release infrastructures, they can deliver malicious payloads under the guise of legitimate software, making detection and prevention more challenging.
  * **Use of Legitimate Tools for Malicious Purposes**


Cybercriminals often utilize legitimate tools and scripts, a tactic known as "," to carry out malicious activities. This approach allows them to blend in with normal system operations, reducing the likelihood of detection by security software.
## 8 Essential Cybersecurity Tips To Protect Yourself From Malvertising
  1. Many users turn to illegal streaming platforms for free content, but these sites are often riddled with malicious ads and scripts. Always use legitimate and trusted streaming services to minimize exposure to cyber threats.
  2. Consider using reputable ad blockers to reduce exposure to potentially malicious advertisements. While not foolproof, ad blockers can minimize the risk of encountering malvertising campaigns. Additionally, script blockers like can stop unauthorized scripts from executing in the browser.
  3. Consider running a that emphasizes security controls.
  4. Keep an eye on your system's behavior. If you notice unusual slowdowns, excessive pop-ups, or unauthorized access attempts, it could be a sign of malware. Regularly check your task manager and review installed applications to spot and remove anything suspicious.
  5. Maintain regular backups of your critical data on external drives or secure cloud services. In the event of a malware infection, having backups ensures you can restore your information without paying ransom or losing valuable data.
  6. Keep your operating system, browsers, and applications updated with the latest security patches.
  7. Avoid clicking on links or ads from unknown sources.
  8. Make sure to use a reputable antivirus program to protect your system. A good antivirus can detect and remove malware before it causes damage.

Microsoft will invest $290 million over the next two years in South Africa on AI and cloud infrastructure, vice chair and president Brad Smith announced.
At an event with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in Johannesburg Thursday, Smith said the investment will help the country’s “ambition to become a globally competitive AI economy.”
It has built massive datacenters in the past three years in Johannesburg and Cape Town, a $1.1 billion investment.
Microsoft is also paying for the certification process for 50,000 young South Africans so they can get qualifications for their digital skills studies.
Smith says this is part of the plan to provide education to Africa’s youngsters, then provide them with certification of having learned those skills to “help” them get a job.
The “high-demand” skills include AI, data science, cybersecurity analysis and cloud solution architecture. This is “even more important,” he stresses. “These are precisely the certificates and skills that win people jobs.”
PROMOTED
“We're in effect paying for people so they can get the training and take the certification exams,” Smith told me. With a “Microsoft certificate for something like cloud architecture or cyber security or AI, you're going to be able to get a job.”
With its endemic poverty, paying for education is a problem for millions of youngsters. “But not everybody can afford to even take the exam to get that certificate,” says Smith.
In January, Microsoft announced it would train on millions Africans in digital skills this year, a continuation of its digital skills program it has been running for several years.
MORE FOR YOU
This will help Africa “become the next global economic powerhouse,” Lillian Barnard, president for Microsoft Africa, said at the time.
Much of this training is done by South Africa’s Youth Employment Service (YES), which “takes talented youth from disadvantaged backgrounds and puts them in their first job,” its CEO Ravi Naidoo tells me.
This private-public partnership with SA’s government has 1,800 corporate partners and has trained 177,000 people so far and is adding about 35,000 every year.
“We want to make sure that talented African youth are confident and competent in the use of AI,” he says. “Both because that will help them adapt to changing sectors and jobs and also enable countries from Africa to be more effective in terms of their using AI in the future.”
Smith is enthusiastic about the skills training, having visited the office of YES, which trains and helps place youngsters.
“Yes is a great organisation that is literally helping 37,000 people a year,” he says.
“We are equipping 50,000 people here in South Africa with that [education] opportunity in the next year. In a sense, infrastructure and skilling go together. They're the two foundational layers, if you will, that an AI economy is built upon,” he told me.
“And I think hopefully what we're doing here today is going to help the whole AI sector, the digital technology sector in South Africa continue to grow at even a faster pace.”
Thanking Microsoft for these investments, Ramaphosa called it “an American company with an African heart”.

The D-ID agent AI team
D-ID
Startup announced a new partnership with Microsoft today to provide enterprises and developers with tools to create agentic AI avatars for Microsoft Teams and other Microsoft software, meeting the highest security standards. Adding a visually engaging, natural layer to AI agents promises to enable appealing customer interactions and more personalized customer experiences.
Replacing “cold and scripted” customer service chatbots with D-ID’s conversational AI avatars provides “a more human and engaging experience,” wrote _Time_ magazine when it included D-ID on its list of . Founded in 2017 as a de-identification solution, D-ID has evolved from a narrow focus on privacy-related technologies to a secure online platform for creating real-time AI Avatars, providing a new interface to LLMs and generative AI applications. “Our vision is to disrupt how humans interface with anything digital. Instead of a graphical user interface, we are going to have a human user interface,” D-ID’s co-founder and CEO Gil Perry me two years ago.
By now, more than 250 million videos have been produced with D-ID’s self-service studio, and more than 280,000 developers are building solutions with the D-ID API. D-ID’s lifelike interactive avatars can be seamlessly integrated with any online conversational agent activity, including marketing, sales, teaching and learning, and customer service. “While the market offers numerous AI agents, D-ID distinguishes itself by specializing in the visual aspect, the human face,” says Perry. “Our real-time video streaming solution provides a more engaging experience with an agent, including visual elements, body movements, accurate lip-sync in any language, personalized voice, and soon, real-time facial expressions and gestures.”
PROMOTED
Rapidly advancing what it calls the Natural User Interface or NUI, the company has introduced over the last year real-time visual AI Agents capable of live interaction; the localization of video content at scale with automated translation; and solutions for marketing teams using avatars at every touchpoint in the marketing funnel. “With over 10,000 businesses and enterprise clients like Fidelity, Deutsche Telekom, AXA, Renault, NTT, and PepsiCo, we are leading the future of emotionally intelligent, seamlessly integrated AI in enterprise workflows,” says Perry.
The new partnership with D-ID is yet another example of how Microsoft is navigating the rapidly-evolving AI landscape. In January, Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella : “…we’re entering the next innings of this AI platform shift. 2025 will be about model-forward applications that reshape all application categories… We will build agentic applications with memory, entitlements, and action space that will inherit powerful model capabilities. And we will adapt these capabilities for enhanced performance and safety across roles, business processes, and industry domains.”

Microsoft has integrated AI capabilities into its Microsoft 365 suite, branding it as “Copilot.” Used by 60% of Fortune 500 companies, Microsoft 365 Copilot leverages generative AI to assist with routine administrative tasks, enhance productivity, and improve business processes. Copilot Studio is a low-code tool for creating —“the new apps for an AI-powered world”—drawing on specific enterprise data. Using Copilot, a Microsoft sales team has achieved 9.4% higher revenue per seller and closed 20% more deals. A Microsoft marketing team saw a 21.5% increase in conversion rate on Azure.com with a custom agent designed to assist buyers.
“Our partnership with Microsoft is incredibly exciting,” says Perry. “We are particularly thrilled by Microsoft's enthusiasm for generative AI and integrating D-ID into their products. This collaboration positions D-ID and Microsoft to lead a market projected to reach a trillion dollars by 2033. We are energized to work with a team that exemplifies the highest level of proficiency and dedication, especially in areas like responsible AI, ethics, and security.”

Christopher J. Fernandez, corporate VP of human resources at Microsoft, recently posted on LinkedIn, “,” and it’s the most insightful piece I’ve readon what executives should do about the coming mash-up of digital and human workers. It makes sense to me that his insights are useful because Microsoft is living at least 24 to 48 months into the future compared to most organizations when it comes to AI adoption and scaled use. Given that AI is moving faster than dog years, that’s a big lead in experience.
## Talent is a Continuum of Human and Digital Workers
The first useful insight is that we are working with what he calls a _total talent continuum_. Continuity of expertise and decision rights is a practical way to think about the problem. Digital workers can help retrieve things, help do a task or perform a task or set of tasks — a continuum of agency. The human talent can teach itself how to use the tools, and one of the coolest things is that generative _AI can not only translate languages but it can translate domains of knowledge and levels of expertise._ Everyone is a novice in something and AI can act as a bridge between the experts in one area and novices in another. This translation function unlocks so much energy and value because so many of an organization’s areas for reinvention and innovation sit at the nexus of different functions or domains. We saw this in our research we wrote about in “” in _Harvard Business Review_ many years ago. AI can help en-skill talent to bridge those gaps to create customer value with both digital and human workers.
## The Birth of a Cognitive Guild: Tool Building As Part of Mastery
Guilds held enormous power in Europe in the 14th to 16th centuries. In Florence, the Arte di Calimala (Guild of the Finished Cloth) commissioned Ghiberti’s famed “” on the Florentine Baptistry at the foot of the grand cathedral. All master craftsmen had their own tools — often specialized and always prized possessions handed down from generation to generation. Likewise, generative AI is enabling experts to build their own cognitive tools. _Microsoft is creating environments where people are inspired to create these tools and share them with the organization._ This ability to change the liquidity and scaling of knowledge will have profound implications on organizations because the marginal cost of creation and sharing is much lower. Skeptics can try one of the as one begins a project on any topic and thereby will see that in less than 30 minutes any individual can begin with a higher level base of expertise than ever before. The quality of an employee’s citizen development chops is becoming part of the evaluation process.

## Transforming From a Bureaucracy to A Knowledge Garden
Napoleon Bonaparte was as capable a designer of modern bureaucracies as he was a warrior. His renovation of the regal French civil service was centered, in the main, on competence not inheritance. (Napoleon’s record in this regard was not without blemish as he had his nepotistic weaknesses, too.) In the modern enterprise, the famed sociologist Max Weber noted that the key features of bureaucracy are: hierarchy, rule creation, rational and impersonal tone and, often, centralization. _Microsoft’s use of AI is more organic than bureaucratic and enables the creation and sharing of knowledge and authority in a more natural form._ Expertise can be codified and shared by citizen programmers who are empowered. The right analogy for this new ecosystem is not the Parisienne office building filled with administrators, but rather an English garden flowering with variety and alive with species. Just as the guided beautiful creations with a judicious shaping of the environment but not too much control, Microsoft, too, is encouraging the flourishing of citizen programmers creating and sharing their knowledge in agents across the organization.
The great challengefor leaders of these hybrid organizations will be to harness the enormous power of digital workers not only to automate many tasks — which it will do — but also to _encourage the growth of a new cognitive guild_ that can create and share new tools and teachers that reinvigorate value creating processes. Executives should note that Microsoft is a fertile garden to “visit” and discover design ideas for their own organizational knowledge landscape.

Windows 11 is finally catching up
NurPhoto via Getty Images
We are fast approaching a crunch point for Microsoft and hundreds of millions of users sticking with software that will no longer receive security updates. This unprecedented situation could lead to security nightmare for the company and for the millions left exposed to an increasingly dangerous cybersecurity landscape.
Microsoft’s free upgrade offer to Windows 11 remains open, . Combined with constant warnings and nags, it is finally putting a dent into the problem. February saw Windows 10 hit a new low, as tens of millions of users suddenly, finally switched to Windows 11, per the latest data from .
PROMOTED
Last year ended badly as regards the Windows 11 upgrade program, with users seemingly ditching Windows 11 to return to Windows 10 in November and December. That left an almost 30% gap between the two, with Windows 10 stubbornly holding above a 60% market share and Windows 11 seemingly unable to get past the mid-30s.
But 2025 has brought two months of accelerating upgrades, and by the end of February —according to this data — Windows 10 was finally down below 60% (58.7%) and Windows 11 was heading towards 40% (38.13%). This 20-point gap is the narrowest it’s been and we’re likely bumping up against those that can’t instead of those that won’t.

Windows 11 finally narrows the gap
Statcounter
The reversal late last year was likely down to Microsoft confirming a one-time, 12-month security extension for Windows 10 users willing to pay the company $30. But the news flow since on security, features and risks has made that seem less appealing.
This year has brought some confusion on whether the free upgrade to Windows 11 is time-boxed and will be withdrawn. Microsoft says it will not for those with the right hardware, as long as it is a fully licensed Windows 10 machine.
Meanwhile, the task of convincing those without the right hardware to buy new PCs continues, triggering what some have warned will be a with all those unusable devices. Microsoft has again promoted the security benefits of new hardware running Windows 11, .
Over the coming months we will find out where that hardware red line is, as upgrades slow towards the October 14th deadline. Will Microsoft remove the $30 hurdle for those stuck on Windows 10? We will find out. But the nightmare of all those devices being exposed to any and all vulnerabilities that hit month by month will become very real.

The race toward scalable quantum computing has reached a pivotal moment, with major players like Microsoft, Google, and IBM pushing forward with breakthroughs. Microsoft's recent announcement of its Majorana 1 chip marks a significant milestone, while Google’s Willow chip and IBM’s long-term quantum roadmap illustrate the industry’s diverse approaches to achieving fault-tolerant quantum systems. As the quantum computing industry debates the timeline for practical implementation, breakthroughs like Majorana 1 and Willow suggest that major advancements may be closer than previously thought. At the same time, skepticism remains, with industry leaders such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang cautioning that meaningful commercial quantum applications could still be decades away.
Microsoft is redefining quantum computing with its new Majorana 1 chip, a significant breakthrough in the pursuit of scalable and fault-tolerant quantum systems. This quantum processor is built on a novel topological architecture that integrates Majorana particles, exotic quantum states that enhance qubit stability and reduce errors. Unlike conventional qubit technologies, which require extensive error correction, Microsoft’s approach aims to build fault tolerance directly into the hardware, significantly improving the feasibility of large-scale quantum computing. Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s CEO, highlighted the significance of this milestone in his LinkedIn post, "We’ve created an entirely new state of matter, powered by a new class of materials, topoconductors. This fundamental leap in computing enables the first quantum processing unit built on a topological core. The path to a million-qubit processor is now within reach—bringing us closer to solving problems beyond the capabilities of classical computing." Despite Microsoft’s claims, there have been questions on the validity of its breakthrough. According to Chetan Nayak, Microsoft Technical Fellow, "We needed to rethink the quantum transistor to ensure stability at scale—this approach provides a clear roadmap for reaching a commercially viable quantum system."
Google has been also making strides in the quantum computing landscape. Google recently introduced its Willow chip, designed to exponentially reduce errors as more qubits are added. The company claims that Willow has achieved two major breakthroughs. First, by leveraging advanced error correction, Willow can significantly lower error rates as the system scales, addressing a challenge the field has pursued for nearly 30 years. Second, in benchmarking tests, Willow performed a computation in under five minutes that would take one of today’s fastest supercomputers an estimated 10 septillion years.
PROMOTED
Both Microsoft and Google’s recent advancements illustrate the industry’s drive toward scalable quantum architectures. However, they are not the only big technology companies pioneering this field.
IBM has maintained its leadership in quantum computing through superconducting transmon qubits and strategic advancements in error correction. In a recent interview with _TIME_ , IBM CEO Arvind Krishna underscored his long-term commitment to quantum computing, stating, "We picked quantum as an area for investment more than 10 years ago. We came to the conclusion that it's an engineering problem more than it's a science problem.”
MORE FOR YOU
On IBM’s long-term market position, Arvind stated, "The people who will exploit it will be all our clients. They will get the value, whether it's material discovery or better batteries or better fertilizers or better drugs. But who can give them a working quantum computer? Assuming the timeline and breakthroughs I'm talking about happen, I think that gives us a tremendous position and a first-mover advantage in that market. We would become the de-facto answer for those technologies." IBM has been providing access to quantum hardware through IBM Cloud since 2016, making quantum experimentation widely available. In 2019, IBM introduced the Quantum System One, the world’s first commercially available, circuit-based quantum computer. The company has continued to push forward, with its quantum processor, Condor, representing another step toward fault-tolerant quantum computing.
On whether quantum computing will cannibalize existing technologies, Arvind predicted, “Technology has always been additive. The smartphone didn't remove the laptop. I think quantum will be additive.”
While Microsoft, Google, and IBM push forward, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang remains skeptical, stating at CES 2025 that quantum computing’s practical use may still be 20 years away. His perspective reflects the industry’s broader concerns over unresolved challenges in scaling quantum systems while handling error correction. Current quantum machines require highly controlled environments, making large-scale deployment difficult. Additionally, commercial viability remains uncertain. While companies continue to make theoretical advancements, real-world applications beyond niche calculations are still limited.
Despite the ongoing debate, the industry is actively preparing for quantum computing’s eventual mainstream adoption. Nvidia has announced its inaugural Quantum Day at GTC 2025, bringing together key players—including Microsoft, Quantinuum, Atom Computing, IonQ, and PsiQuantum—to discuss the state of the field and the path forward.
In summary, quantum computing is advancing rapidly, yet the path to commercial adoption remains unclear. While Microsoft’s Majorana 1 and Google’s Willow chips present promising recent breakthroughs, the challenges of error correction, hardware scaling, and practical implementation persist. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s cautionary stance serves as a reminder that, despite the hype, widespread adoption of quantum computing may still be decades away. Hence, the debate over the realistic timeline for quantum computing’s practical adoption remains active.
As the industry moves forward, one thing is clear: the competition among Microsoft, Google, IBM, and others will continue to drive innovation, shaping the next era of computing.

Avowed
Obsidian
As we wade through Xbox’s “any first party game, any time can come to PS5” approach to this generation, that obviously raises questions about the games that have _not_ yet made it to its rival console. Most recently, that would be Avowed.
Avowed is the new AA-ish RPG from Obsidian, creator of Fallout: New Vegas and The Outer Worlds. It was received , though its 80 score is not as good as it could be for what is likely going to be the largest “true exclusive” on Xbox this year, now that Fable has been delayed (of course it was). But should it stay exclusive?
It’s a fair question to ask as Microsoft has repeatedly said that nothing is off the table. If Master Chief and Marcus Fenix aren’t, why should Avowed be?
Avowed has not been announced as heading to PS5. Not on a time delay, not at all. But will it? And when? Is it time now, based on how the game performed? While PS5 fans may be looking to celebrate a “win” by having Avowed head over (plus you know, the ability ), I have my doubts about Microsoft giving this one away, at least so soon. Here’s the case for and against:

Avowed
Obsidian
**AGAINST**
  * It’s one thing when you announce pretty early on that something is going to be on a time delay (Indiana Jones) or same day launch (DOOM: The Dark Ages), but it would be another to spring it on fans that a game like Avowed is heading to PS5. Maybe they subscribed to Game Pass for it. Maybe they bought it. But you can see how that would create annoyance and even more uncertainty about Microsoft’s current release plans if this happened any time soon.
  * Avowed is based on the Pillars of Eternity universe, yes, but it more or less exists as a new IP, and that’s something Microsoft previously said they would not give away. While explaining their rationale for keeping Call of Duty multiplatform as they argued in court to buy Activision Blizzard, they said that original, first party IPs were the types of things that would stay exclusive to Xbox, not big, established series like Call of Duty.
  * We have an example of this very thing happening. At least not yet. That would be Starfield, Bethesda’s big new game that was out in September of 2023, and a year and a half later, is not on PS5, nor has it been announced for PS5. Even if “nothing is off the table” that does not mean “everything is eventually going.”

Avowed
Obsidian
MORE FOR YOU
**FOR**
  * Obsidian said that Microsoft was happy with how Avowed is performing, but in this current software-spreading era, Microsoft also wants…sales, and they are now the biggest publisher on PlayStation, which is wild to see (mainly due to Call of Duty). Bringing Avowed to PS5 would obvious result in far more sales than they currently have.
  * Obviously, the majority of Xbox players played Avowed on Game Pass, and Game Pass ensures far less box copy/digital sales as part of its very nature. But looking outside of the non-Xbox ecosystem, I’m not sure I can say Avowed performed amazingly on Steam. It there in an era where rival, less high-profile RPGs like Kingdom Come: Deliverance II peaked at 256,000 there. Even the “failed” Dragon Age: The Veilguard peaked at 89,000 (albeit with a much larger budget, no doubt). I don’t think Avowed is some sort of disaster, but Microsoft would not be sad if it moved a few million more copies on PS5.


What will happen? I’m going to give it a least a year before this is either announced or actually happens, but judging by Starfield, hey, maybe not.

Microsoft patches six Windows zero-days.

Across and combined, Windows users had already been exposed to a total of five so-called zero-day exploits where attackers had already struck in the wild before a patch could be made available. March has just beaten that with a worrying six Windows zero-days being confirmed by Microsoft in the latest Patch Tuesday security announcement. Here’s what you need to know.
## Windows Operating System Security Patches Should Be your Top Priority This Month
You might be excused for thinking, at least after a casual glance, that this month Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday security round up is nothing too dramatic. After all, the overall Common vulnerabilities and Exposures count is relatively low at “just” 57. However, as Tyler Reguly, associate director of security research and development at Fortra, said, “buckle up because admins may be in for a ride.” With six zero-day vulnerabilities listed as exploit detected, and six where Microsoft has labeled the severity as critical, this is not the time to sit back and relax. Quite the opposite, in fact. The good news, Reguly said, is that all six of the exploit detected zero-days are resolved with the monthly cumulative update. “This means a single update to roll out to fix all of these at once,” Reguly concluded, with none of them requiring any post-patch configuration steps.

Chris Goettl, vice president of security product management at Ivanti, meanwhile, said that in the Midwest there’s a saying about March which goes in like a lion, out like a lamb. “At first glance, the looks like a lamb, but this lamb might have the teeth of a lion,” Goettl continued. The teeth being referred to are, of course, those zero-days. “The zero-day exploits affect the Microsoft Management Console, NTFS, Fast FAT, and the Win32 Kernel Subsystem,” Goettl said. As such, Goettl recommended that this Windows operating system update should be the top priority update this month.

## The Six Windows Zero-Days In Detail
**CVE-2025-26633** is a security feature bypass in the Microsoft Management Console. “An attacker needs to convince a potential target that is either a standard user or has admin privileges to open a malicious file to exploit this vulnerability,” Satnam Narang, a senior staff research engineer at Tenable, said, “and social engineering is certainly one of the easiest ways to make this happen.”
**CVE 2024-24993** is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability within Windows NTFS. “An attacker can potentially exploit this issue by prompting users to mount a specially crafted virtual hard disk,” Henry Smith, a senior security engineer at Automox, said. A successful zero-day attack using this vulnerability could result in an unauthorized attacker executing arbitrary code locally.
**CVE-2025-24991** is an information disclosure vulnerability in Windows NTFS that affects all Windows editions from and Server 2008 to Server 2025. “Risk-based prioritization warrants treating this vulnerability as critical,” Goettl warned.
**CVE-2025-24985** is a vulnerability within the Windows fast FAT file system driver, the first to be detected for three years. “It was reported anonymously,” Narang said, “so we don’t have any specific details around it.” What we do know is that it could lead to remote code execution if a user is tricked into mounting a specially crafted virtual hard disk.
**CVE-2025-24983** is a Windows Win32 kernel subsystem elevation of privilege vulnerability that, if successfully exploited, could give unauthorized access to sensitive data, credentials, encryption keys, and system information. “CVE-2025-24983 provides a direct path from low privileges to SYSTEM access,” Alex Vovk, CEO and co-founder of Action1, said, “making it an attractive target for attackers with initial access via phishing, malware, compromised credentials, or insider threats.”
**CVE-2025-24984** is another information disclosure vulnerability in Windows NTFS that affects all Windows editions from Windows 10 to 11 and Server 2008 to Server 2025. As with CVE-2025-24991, Goettl said that risk-based prioritization warrants treating this vulnerability as critical.

Like it or not, we’re operating in a world of virtual communication. Sure, we still have face-to-face conversations, but a growing percentage of our interactions are via Zoom, Microsoft Teams, FaceTime, Slack, and a range of other tools.
Such tools clearly offer advantages, not the least of which are reductions in time and travel. But like any good tool, these must be used carefully.
Andrew Brodsky offers valuable guidance in _._ Harvard-trained Brodsky is an award-winning business professor at the University of Texas at Austin. He provides an actionable framework for navigating virtual communication from mode choice to message framing.
He uses PING as an acronym representing the “parts” of that framework:
  * **“P” stands for perspective taking.** When you aren’t standing face to face with another person, you often become more self-focused. As a result, you generally aren’t as attentive to how your messages will be perceived and how others might interpret them differently from how they were intended. By making more of a conscious effort to take the perspective of your interaction partner, you can meaningfully reduce miscommunication.
  * **“I” stands for initiative.** Every communication mode has its strengths and weaknesses. However, by realizing what those are, you can take the initiative to “fill back in” what’s missing. For instance, since small talk and trust-building doesn’t occur as naturally over text as it does in person, making an effort to engage in this kind of behavior virtually can help strengthen outcomes like trust.
  * **“N” stands for nonverbal.** Even though you’re sitting behind your computer, you’re still conveying nonverbal signals that your interaction partners will use to assess your communication. Something as seemingly simple as including an emoji (or starting an email without a salutation) communicates information that will shape other people’s perspectives of your messages. Consequently, understanding the research behind all the varying nonverbal behaviors we communicate electronically is central to ensuring your interactions accomplish your goals.
  * **“G” stands for goals.** In order to choose the right mode and message for any given situation, it’s first necessary to define your goals. For instance, cameras-on video calls can be useful for showing engagement and building trust, but cameras-off video calls are more helpful for reducing fatigue and stress. Hence, the right choice in any interaction will depend on your primary underlying goal.


The Covid pandemic clearly accelerated the use of Zoom and other tools for virtual communication. What does Brodsky see as both the benefits and costs of that trend?

“As with any communication technology, there are strengths and weaknesses to using video tools like Zoom,” he says. “As far as strengths, video communication has increased the ease in which we can more richly interact with people around the world, whether from the home or office. The greater adoption of these tools has saved a massive amount time and money due to a decreased need to travel. And of course, they have been a factor in what has made remote and hybrid work so effective.”
MORE FOR YOU
And what does Brodsky see as downsides? “Video tools reduce the degree of nonverbal behavior, as you can generally see people only from the shoulders up. Additionally, video calls—relative to in-person meetings—make it easier for people to become distracted. Since people in the meeting can no longer see exactly what others are doing, it’s easier to do things like check your email during meetings.”
In what ways can email and other electronic tools become productivity sinkholes?
“It can be difficult to stay productive when you’re juggling a seemingly endless stream of text messages, instant messages, emails, phone calls, and video meetings,” Brodsky says. “If not carefully managed, your virtual communication can take over and become a productivity sinkhole.” He says way to avoid this issue is to “chunk” your virtual communication into a few confined time periods throughout the work day. “This way, you won’t miss out on any important communication while still having long stretches to focus on deep work.”
Brodsky says that to increase productivity, it sometimes makes sense to use email or instant messaging. On the other hand, productivity can often be maximized with richer modes of communication.
“To choose the most productive mode, it really depends on the context and your goal,” he says. “For instance, if you need to ask your boss a quick clarification question, it likely makes sense to send an instant message or email (rather than request a phone call or meeting). In contrast, a brief phone call or meeting can be more effective than an ongoing email chain when a lot of back-and-forth is required.”

.
.
As former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg emphasizes, “leaders should strive for authenticity over perfection.” What does Brodsky believe that suggests about how leaders should engage in virtual communication?
“Because it can often feel like we’re communicating with a screen rather than an actual person, it’s important for all of us (including leaders) to demonstrate authenticity and trustworthiness in our virtual communication,” he says. “It really comes back to adding in those personal touches that might be lost in a flurry of emails. For instance, instead of announcing a significant policy change via email, it might be beneficial for a leader to initiate a few one-on-one calls with managers first, and then have an all-hands call for the rest of the team to let them know of the changes and then invite employees to send any follow-up questions via email.”
Brodsky points out that trust is like Wi-Fi. It’s invisible, but you know when it’s not there. So, in using virtual communication tools, what are the trust-busters and what are the trust-builders?
“When trying to build trust with someone new, it’s often helpful to use richer modes (e.g., video) so you can add more of a ‘human’ element to the interaction,” he says. “Additionally, making the effort to show you care about the other person, for instance by asking them questions about themselves, is even more important virtually, as effort and engagement can’t be as easily observed from behind a screen.”
At a time of so much workplace pressure, how can people we avoid burnout amid all of this virtual communication overload?
“Left unchecked, our virtual communication can blur the lines between work and home and cause burnout,” Brodsky says. “One strategy to combat this effect is to put your work devices away and intentionally engage in leisure activities to completely disconnect. Also, volunteering and spending time in nature have been found to be particularly useful for disconnecting and recharging.”

This is not it, this is a Steam Deck
Valve
While Microsoft says it’s not getting out of the hardware game, despite plummeting Xbox Series X/S sales this generation, there does appear to be a new device coming that actually makes perfect sense, and may be a rare advantage it has over Sony going forward.
This week, confirming that an Xbox-branded handheld is coming, and will actually launch at the end of this year. This is not exactly just…a portable Xbox, but something closer to a PC handheld the way we’ve seen with the extremely popular Valve Steam Deck, seen above.
But the report says this will certainly be Xbox-branded from its buttons to its logos to even a Guide button. Though the point here is apparently to produce a PC device that will use the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass. But, as we know, if you buy a first party game for Xbox you also get it in the Microsoft store so in that sense, it sort of _does_ operate like a portable Xbox for some titles.

This is not the next generation Xbox. That is still a thing that is coming. But this device arriving potentially at the end of this year is a big deal, and is a one-up on Sony who well, does not have a portable PlayStation device. At least not yet. There have been rumblings it’s making one, but despite its history with the PSP and Vita, it is not going to be first to market. And Microsoft has an innate advantage with its integrated PC capabilities.
MORE FOR YOU
Sony has also had a bit of a rough time with the PS5 Pro, a device which has had at least some measure of technical problems where at times, its upgrades are failing to impress or even on occasion, making some games look worse. There have been issues with PSSR specifically, but it’s just been announced that the upcoming FSR 4 will improve that. Meanwhile, Microsoft is skipping a mid-gen upgrade. You can view that as smart, or you can view that as obvious given the lack of sales of the two models it already has.
What we don’t know is the price of the Xbox/PC Handheld. Using the , we have:
  * $400 – 256 GB, LCD
  * $550 – 512 GB, OLED
  * $650 – 1 TB, OLED


So, only one of those is cheaper than the current Xbox Series X, and the others escalate the price rather quickly. Still, this seems like a great path for Xbox to go down, and if it can get it out before the holiday season with PlayStation’s concept for a similar device still ages away? That’s a big win.

The idea of a penguin mascot comes from Linux creator Linus Torvalds. 
Ian Parker
Microsoft wants to claim 2025 as the year of the “Windows 11 Refresh.” Instead, let’s claim it as the year you take back control over your computer, and make your PC personal again. As the countdown moves closer to the end of Windows 10 support this October, here are some compelling reasons to quit Windows and give Linux a try.
Before we dive in, I want to acknowledge something: familiarity is comfortable, and change can be challenging! You may experience a slight learning curve using Linux, especially when your muscle memory is used to years of Windows. But that doesn’t mean using Linux is more difficult. It’s just _different_.
PROMOTED
I encourage people to start exploring Linux now, using it side-by-side with Windows through the process of dual-booting. This gives you time to acclimate and discover the subtle and frequently enjoyable differences. Then, make the switch when you’re ready.
## 1: Linux Extends The Life Of Your PC — For Free
Do you ever get the troublesome feeling that Microsoft owns your computer just as much as you do?
MORE FOR YOU
Microsoft has on its stance that TPM 2.0 (a security chip on your PC’s motherboard) is "a non-negotiable standard for the future of Windows," making it clear that Redmond will not back down on the hardware requirements for Windows 11.
More than three years after its launch, Windows 11 is still struggling to surpass Windows 10's market share. When support for Windows 10 ends in October 2025, tens of millions of consumers will feel forced to needlessly buy new hardware, because it is genuinely dangerous to run Windows without crucial updates to protect you. Unless, of course, you want to pay a fee to receive extended security updates for a limited time. But even that extended support will only last for an additional year until you’re left out in the cold.
Because of this non-negotiable TPM 2.0 requirement, estimates suggest that 240 million PCs currently running Windows 10 are not "capable" of upgrading to Windows 11. Yet those same machines can effortlessly run any flavor of Linux, which could prevent literal tons of e-waste.
Instead of buying a brand new laptop or desktop PC, you could use Linux to accomplish the vast majority — if not the entirety — of what you do on Windows 10. Without sacrificing performance or usability. For a total cost of absolutely nothing.
Viewing the situation in this light, it can be argued that Microsoft is essentially selling e-waste as software by not offering a reasonable upgrade path. I promise you the PC Microsoft insists will be obsolete come October 2025 is going to run like a dream on Linux.
## 2: Installing Software On Linux Is Fast And Easy
Maybe you’ve heard antiquated horror stories about having to download a binary, fire up a command line terminal window to extract the contents, grant the appropriate permissions, and maybe even “compile” the package for your specific hardware, rest assured those days are long gone.
Now? Installing software is even easier than on Windows. This is largely because of a software packaging format called “Flatpak.” In a nutshell, Flatpak is like a universal app store for all of Linux. It takes all the confusion out of installing an app on your specific Linux distribution. It works a bit like the app store on your smartphone. You don’t need to worry about installing dependencies, or finding the right version for Pop OS, Ubuntu, Fedora, Bazzite, Linux Mint, Zorin OS, or any other flavor of Linux. It’s just going to work.
Flatpak is a fantastic way to install a huge variety of software, and it’s pre-installed on most major Linux distributions. (If it’s not, there are easy .)
![Screenshot of several apps on an app store, including browsers and gaming software. ](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67c885bcbd1d13a34fb71d7e/Screenshot-of-several-apps-on-an-app-store--including-browsers-and-gaming-software-/960x0.png?format=png&width=144)
A screenshot from Flathub, a universal app store for Linux. 
Jason Evangelho
And if you’re worried about hunting for open-source alternatives to many of your favorite apps, those _do_ exist — but they’re not required. Your major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge) are here. Zoom, Discord, Slack, Signal, Telegram, and WhatsApp are all there. Spotify? You bet. Steam? Of course. OBS Studio for streaming and Visual Studio Code for coding? Absolutely. Microsoft Office is still missing from the mix, but web versions will work perfectly.
Seriously, installing these apps is a breeze! So is updating them.
## 3: Linux Gets Out Of Your Way
It’s an undeniable truth that Windows tends to beg for attention, desperate to be noticed. Whether it’s the vaguely scary warnings from Windows Defender, the constant nags to enable OneDrive backups and subscribe to Office 365, the full-screen Edge takeovers, the irrelevant news headlines, the unwanted web results when using Windows search, the lock screen ads, the “Let’s finish setting up your PC” reminders, the mandatory Microsoft account needed just to install and use Windows... it can be exhausting.
And I haven’t even touched on the multitude of headaches associated with Windows updates.
That’s what makes using Linux so refreshing. There are no mandatory online accounts. There is no signing over your personal data to corporate overlords in the name of perceived convenience. Your Linux OS isn’t constantly trying to sell you a subscription, or nag you about things. It simply gets out of your way and makes using your PC more enjoyable, more personal, and more private.
It feels very much like this:
![Linux updates](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67c893264ac42155e1dab169/Linux-updates/0x0.png?format=png&crop=1310,739,x43,y0,safe&width=144)
How Linux updates feel
Introverse
Yea, updates are delightful. Linux updates never steal focus or intrudes on your work. They never force a reboot. And all those Flatpak apps you installed? They all get updated right along with your core system files.
## 4: Linux Gaming Is Awesome Now
Read any recent review of a gaming handheld like the Legion Go S, and you’ll notice a common thread running through every single one: it’s disappointing that it uses Windows and not Valve’s Linux-powered SteamOS. That sentiment is a reflection of how the larger conversation around Windows versus Linux gaming has shifted substantially in the past several years.
Enabled by early work from Codeweavers, Valve (the company behind ) has worked tirelessly since 2018 to improve gaming on Linux. We now live in a world where the vast majority of Windows games just work on Linux thanks to an innovative “compatibility layer” called Proton. You don’t need to concern yourself with any of the technical details though; it’s built right in to Steam.
The fact that one of the largest computer makers on the planet is releasing its next gaming handheld with the , and not Windows, speaks volumes about how far Linux gaming has progressed.
The work Valve and others are doing to enable such a great user experience and wide-reaching game compatibility on devices like Steam Deck? That also translates to the desktop experience.
Stay tuned for some future articles devoted to Linux gaming, since this only scratches the surface.
## How To Switch To Linux?
The process of switching to Linux deserves its own series of articles. The admittedly overwhelming choice of where to start and how to choose the right Linux distribution can also be viewed in a positive light; Linux is diverse enough to fit your exact needs.
Put another way, there is no “one size fits all” answer. And don’t listen to anyone insisting otherwise. If someone recommends a specific Linux distribution without first asking you questions about your personal preferences and specific use-cases, they’re not out to help you; they’re merely a cheerleader of something they enjoy.
In the near future I’ll be writing a series of guides helping you navigate the switch, and how to get the most out of your experience. For now, I hope I’ve at least sparked your curiosity about Linux. I’ve been using it for 7 years and have fallen in love with the freedom, flexibility, and customization it provides.

Sick of all those darn employees? Tired of hearing about "quiet quitters" and "barely minimum Monday" workers? Struggling to deal with the high cost of health insurance, retirement plans, regulations and taxes? Fear not! Big tech is coming to your rescue with AI agents to replace your employees.
Thanks to the good people at Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Salesforce - and a bunch of up and coming startups - small and mid-sized companies can now begin to harness the power of AI to get rid of all those workers.
Of course, that’s not exactly the narrative Silicon Valley wants you to hear. But pay no attention to what those companies are saying. Instead, take a look at what they're doing.
## Microsoft Introduces Sales AI Agents To Replace Your Employees
For starters, Microsoft a new AI tool to replace your employees on your sales team. According to Microsoft, the newly launched Sales Agent will help you eliminate those sales administrators who are researching leads, setting up meetings, reaching out to customers and even closing "low-impact" sales leads. It leverages either it's Dynamics CRM application or Salesforce as its data model.
PROMOTED
In case you weren't aware, Microsoft has also amassed a gigantic ecosystem of AI agents, with - - over 100,000 organizations "creating or editing AI agents through its Copilot Studio since launch – a milestone that positions the company ahead in one of enterprise tech’s most closely watched and exciting segments." Do not forget that agents are literally doing the work of people. People that will no longer have any work to do. But enough about Microsoft. Let's move on...to Amazon!
## Amazon Forms A Group To Develop AI Agents To Replace Employees
Because just last week Amazon announced that it formed a new group specifically to help their AWS customers use AI to...you guessed it...replace employees. The focus group, led by an AWS executive, aims to "help users and customers automate more of their lives" but we all know what that means: new AI tools from one of the leading cloud service providers that will do the work of programmers, developers and other IT support people.
"We have the opportunity to help our customers innovate even faster and unlock more possibilities, and I firmly believe that AI agents are core to this next wave of innovation," AWS' CEO . Using an agent instead of tech support? Try to find a business owner that would turn that opportunity down. Let’s see what Meta is doing, shall we?
## Meta Has A New Customer Service Tool Using AI Agents To Replace Your Employees
The social media giant is now is offering a new to help small businesses replace their employees. it's a 24/7 service that can be used on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to answer questions - even by voice - as well as facilitate purchases from users. According businesses "can design these agents, which can operate both straight off of ads and also through DMs or Messenger, at no cost right now as the pilot program kicks off." They can also delegate which tasks they want the AI agent to handle, and which tasks they want the AI to hand off to a live customer service representative," assuming there are any left. Their agent can help manage returns, recommend products and purchase products.
## Salesforce Create A Giant Exchange of AI Agents To Replace Your Employees
Not only is Salesforce participating in Microsoft’s replacement of employees with agents, but the CRM giant a giant "exchange" for developers to trade, share, collaborate and come up with all sorts of different methods for AI agents to replace your employees. It's called AgentExchange which the company estimates will be part of a "$6 trillion 'digital labor' market" which sounds a lot like a place that uses technology to do the work instead of people. The company has already signed up 200 partners, including Google, DocuSign and Workday who are - or plan to - put together pre-packaged "agent solutions" that work off the Salesforce platform to...you guessed it...use AI agents to replace your employees.
## ServiceNow Rolls Out An AI Agent To Supervise AI Agents To Replace Your Employees
All of these agents can just run amok, can they? ServiceNow doesn’t think so. Agents are proliferating to such an extent that the IT support platform that helps businesses automate and organize processes and services a tool to supervise all the AI agents that are replacing your employees. They call it the AI Agent Orchestrator and it's music to the ears of any business owner who wants to employ dozens of AI agents to do the work of employees no longer on their payroll and needs an agent to manage all of these agents. The company is offering "thousands of prebuilt agents across IT, customer service, HR and more!!!" (I added in the exclamation marks) to "drive exponential productivity at scale."
## Other Startups Are Providing Tools For Creating AI Agents To Replace Your Employees
Don't want to wait for big tech to help you use AI agents to replace your employees? No worries, you can use tools from , , or to build your own AI agent solutions. Or you can join Agent Accelerator Program, which offers "seamless integration, expert customization, and comprehensive support to bring your AI agent to life."
None of these companies will say that their agents are replacing employees. Instead they all make claims that their technology will "improve productivity" and "complement" workers. They say that companies are already facing worker shortages or lack the resources to grow and scale so these agents are offering a way to do more with an existing workforce. It's not a bad argument. But c'mon...do you truly buy it? What business owner wouldn't invest in agents instead of hiring people, with all of their related costs and responsibilities?
Make no mistake about it. Big tech companies are using AI agents to replace your employees.

Don’t leave it too late to update your PC.
NurPhoto via Getty Images
Microsoft users are under attack. This month’s Patch Tuesday addresses another six actively exploited vulnerabilities amongst dozens of other fixes. This has prompted the to warn users to update PCs by April 1st or turn them off.
Trend Micro’s describes “the number of actively exploited bugs [as] extraordinary.” And while those half-dozen zero-days will take the headlines, there are other “frightening-looking bugs” as well. In total, Microsoft has released “56 new CVEs in Windows and Windows Components, Office and Office Components, Azure, .NET and Visual Studio, Remote Desktop Services, DNS Server, and Hyper-V Server… With the addition of the third-party CVEs, the entire release tops out at 67 CVEs.”
As puts it, the update includes “a dirty dozen flaws competing for your urgent attention – six of them rated critical and another six already being exploited by criminals.” This month’s CVEs can be found here, . What is clear is this is certainly not the time to put security updates at risk.
PROMOTED
And on that note, this update is particularly interesting — as will be each one through to October — as there remain some 800 million users on Windows 10, which will end security updates on October 14th. Perhaps as many as of those Windows 10 holdouts do not have PCs capable of a free Windows 11 upgrade. Most of the others — one expects/hopes — will shift to Windows 11 before the deadline.
MORE FOR YOU
As I reported earlier this week, after an alarming end to 2024 with Windows 10 building back market share at Windows 11’s expense, . Around 2% of the install base seems to be moving across each month, with Windows 10 now down below 60% for the first time and Windows 11 bumping up toward 40%.
Microsoft is shutting down workarounds and reinforcing that Windows 11 upgrades are only available for those with a fully licensed Windows 10 machine capable of the leap. Its guidance — — warns “support for Windows 10 will end in October 2025. After October 14, 2025, Microsoft will no longer provide free software updates from Windows Update, technical assistance, or security fixes for Windows 10. Your PC will still work, but we recommend moving to Windows 11.”
Those with Windows 10 PCs not capable of an upgrade need to act before the deadline hits and security updates cease. The sheer scale of exploited vulnerabilities thus far this year illustrates just how risky it will be to leave PCs exposed. If you’d rather pay $30 and buy yourself an extra year, rather than fund a new machine, then do that. Actively exploited vulnerabilities are stacking up month by month, and the longer you leave a device exposed, the more vulnerable you become to an attack.
Per , this is a “whopping number of Microsoft zero-days under attack,” and a number of fixes that is “the company’s second-largest ever.” As October nears, you can expect to read more about those being pushed to upgrade PCs when they cannot afford to do so, and the scale of landfill from hundreds of millions of PCs being rendered useless all at once. None of that changes the fundamentals, though.
You need to act before it’s too late.

You need to update for free while you can.
NurPhoto via Getty Images
Microsoft has a problem on its hands. Windows 10 will crash into end of life in October, with likely hundreds of millions of users yet to upgrade to Windows 11. And while for most of 2024 there was a steady albeit small shift from the older to the newer OS, towards the end of the year some lost ground. February’s stats will be critical, to confirm the shift to Windows 11 is still gaining momentum.
That move to Windows 11 is free if — — you have both a paid-up version of Windows 10 _and_ a PC that meets the technical and security hurdles for the upgrade. If the PC fails the technical check then so does the free upgrade. For a time it seemed that on those requirements, .
PROMOTED
There was also a time when it seemed that the free upgrade was timeboxed, with a. blogpost titled “Free Upgrade to Windows 11 (For a Limited Time Only).” But again that advice was clarified and . There is an assumption that the free upgrade won’t expire, even as the October end of life passes, but that’s not formally confirmed by the company and so be careful.
There remains a risk that once Windows 10 becomes a retired OS, a free upgrade deadline will be revisited. That blogpost didn’t come from nowhere. But now post that has been deleted, all we know formally is that "the free upgrade offer does not have a specific end date for eligible systems; however, Microsoft reserves the right to eventually end support for the free offer." I have asked if there’s any change to this.
Even if the free offer doesn’t expire on October 14th, security updates will. And so you should take the offer before that date if your PC is compatible. There are still somewhere between 300 and 400 million users who can upgrade but haven’t yet, and maybe the same again who will need new hardware.
Upgrading a non-compatible PC with one of the workarounds still available will likely remove invalidate any remaining hardware as well as software support. Your options are to pay Microsoft $30 for a 12-month support extension or to buy a new PC — the option the marketeers are pushing hard, .

Chinese scientists have unveiled the that reportedly operates . This breakthrough, developed by researchers at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), represents a dramatic escalation in the global quantum computing competition, with performance claims that go neck-to-neck with Google’s Willow. As the race heats up, seems closer than ever. However, skeptics argue it is still decades away, even as new and increasingly impressive breakthroughs and advancements occur more frequently.
## **The Technical Achievement: Fidelity and Coherence**

The Zuchongzhi-3 announcement intensifies what has become a high-stakes international competition. Google, which first claimed , recently unveiled its . While matching Zuchongzhi-3's qubit count, Willow takes a different approach by focusing heavily on —allowing it to perform computations in under five minutes that would theoretically take classical supercomputers approximately 10 septillion years.

You need to make this Gmail change now

With on Gmail and other email platforms, there has never been more focus on attack resistant account security. This becomes even more critical as threat actors find ways to , setting fire to our safety nets. Google has decided to change how we log into Gmail, but you need to take a different approach.
It’s now time to stop using passwords and 2FA. Microsoft has confirmed its intent to move its billion-plus users to passkeys, rendering passwords and 2FA redundant. But critically Microsoft has also said it’s not enough to setup a passkey, , otherwise it leaves a vulnerable route open into an account.
Google has acknowledged the same issue. When Google started to in 2023, it was hailed as . But passwords will remain, it says, “for example when using devices that don’t support passkeys yet.” But while it isn’t yet talking mass deletion, it has said creating a passkey allows us to pay closer attention to the sign-ins that fall back to passwords. Over time, we’ll increasingly scrutinize these as passkeys gain broader support and familiarity.”
PROMOTED
As I reported last week, . And while Google will seemingly resolve network 2FA vulnerabilities with QR codes, . Ignore any changes to 2FA and follow the much more critical advice and set up passkeys on all your accounts that support them. And that certainly includes Gmail and any other email you use.
When you do set up your passkey, change your password for something horribly long, complex and unique, and add the strongest 2FA method you can. You won’t use it often, so it doesn’t have to be convenient. Clearly don’t use SMS unless you have no choice.
Longer term, now that Microsoft has been open with its users on all the reasons they need to delete passwords and move wholesale to passkeys, notwithstanding some of the teething issues that remain, what should Google/Gmail users expect? If 2023 was “the beginning of the end of the password,” in its own words, when will come the mandatory push to passkeys with the password/2FA combination finally deleted?
Rather than address the SMS issue, I’d rather see Google and Microsoft push to take passkeys to the next level. Deadlines and a combination of incentives to change and disincentives to stick with the old. No change should be made to 2FA without it being couched in a passkey campaign as the first option. Better securing 2FA as a fallback is fine, but we don’t want to see this as a common login tool.
As I’ve said elsewhere, . We’re not there yet, with either Gmail or Outlook or any of the other platforms, thus the Xmail tease. But kudos to Google for some of the changes it’s bringing. , for example, will make a huge difference in the fight against scam. What we need to see next is transparent on-device scam detection, as we’re seeing in the mobile OS world. That would at least be a start in a much needed email modernization.
Now you’ve finished the article, go set up your passkey unless you’ve done so already. It’s the best way you have of keeping your account safe and secure.

Investing Mistake
getty
I recently got some reader feedback that made me realize something: When it comes to our favorite income investments—8%+ yielding —there are still a lot of misconceptions out there.
It’s key that we put those right, because they’re causing some investors to miss out on CEFs, and the big (and often monthly) dividends they provide. And I know I don’t have to tell you that in turbulent times like these, high payouts like those are a lifesaver.
This reader wrote in response to about how CEFs can be better than ETFs, pointing out two things:
PROMOTED
  1. The three CEFs I mentioned in the piece have higher expense ratios than passive funds.
  2. There are cheaper ways to buy stocks that the CEFs I wrote about in that article own (more on them below), such as **Microsoft (MSFT)** , a major holding of all three of these CEFs.


Let’s address both of these concerns because they _are_ valid—and both are often cited by financial advisors and the mainstream media as reasons to avoid CEFs and invest in ETFs, like the **SPDR S &P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)**.
Following that advice can cost you significant dividends: CEFs currently yield 8.5% on average, while SPY, the largest ETF by market cap, yields a paltry 1.4%.
So, let’s dig into the first issue.
MORE FOR YOU
## Closed-End Funds Have Higher Fees … Right?
I am not going to disagree with the feedback here, because it is true.
On average, have management fees of 2.9%, which sounds very high compared to what you’d pay on the average index fund.
I should note before we go further, though, that the two CEFs we’ll get into below (both of which appeared in the article)—the **Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (AIO) **and the **Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK)** —charge much less: about 2.7% for AIO and 1.1% for STK.
The fees for the **BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST)** , the other fund mentioned in that article, are about the same as STK, at 1.09%, but we’re going to focus more on the other two funds, and the opportunity we have in them, today.
Here’s where our reader picked up on a common misunderstanding about CEF fees, suggesting that these fees are taken out of the income and total returns these funds provide. In other words, if the fee were to be taken out of AIO’s dividend, its 7.8% yield would actually amount to 5.1%, net of fees.
But this isn’t how CEF fees work.
Let’s take the most important detail first: The fees that CEFs charge are taken out of the fund’s portfolio _before_ distributing dividends. The fund will not remove it from the yield you receive: If AIO yields 7.8%, that means you will get $780 a year for every $10,000 you invest. The fees are taken care of on the back end, before AIO reports its capital gains and pays out distributions, so all the profits I’m about to show you are _net of fees_.
Are the fees justified? In my opinion, getting $78,000 on a million-dollar nest egg is worth it, since the low-fee alternative offers $14,000 in dividends on that same million bucks.
Also, I should point out that those CEF fees tend to remain as low as possible because of competition. The fees that CEFs charge are a combination of administrative fees, payment to fund managers (which is often the smallest part of the fund’s assets, typically around 0.07%), and payment for things like leverage costs (both of these funds typically borrow money to fund investments, and AIO is currently borrowing more than STK, which is why its fees are higher).
In the end, though, is why I think the fees are justified, even without accounting for these funds’ much higher yields.
![CEFs-Outperform](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67c9dabe0bfbc8f856a27241/CEFs-Outperform/960x0.png?format=png&width=144)
CEFs Outperform
Ycharts
Both AIO (in blue) and STK (in purple) have outperformed the S&P 500 since AIO’s inception (it was released in late 2019, which is why this chart goes only that far). And STK’s outperformance goes back much further.
![STK-Total-Returns](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67c9dae5d67cf789b6684c32/STK-Total-Returns/960x0.png?format=png&width=144)
STK Total Returns
Ycharts
Now, to be sure, these funds are weighted toward tech, but it is also worth pointing out that the S&P 500 has been increasingly weighted to tech stocks (now about 45% of the index), which explains some of the outperformance here.
But with fees as “high” as the ones they’re charging, you’d expect SPY to be more competitive (again net of fees).
To be sure, the SPY shareholder paid less in fees. But the SPY shareholder also missed out on $1.137 of profits for every dollar they would have put into STK when it launched.
## Cheaper Ways to Buy Stocks?
The second criticism also has some merit, although maybe not in the way the reader meant. Let me explain.
![CEF-Premiums](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67c9db0aee1fbd85b37bd705/CEF-Premiums/960x0.png?format=png&width=144)
CEF Premiums
Ycharts
Both of these funds have a fixed number of shares they issue to the general public (this is fixed at the IPO). This is why the fund is called a _closed_ end fund. While those shares trade on exchanges, like any stock, the issuer can’t issue new shares to grow the fund.
The price of a share of a CEF will fluctuate according to supply and demand, which means its market price can drift up or down from the liquidation value of all of its assets on the open market, which is called the net asset value, or NAV.
Above you can see AIO is trading at a 6.5% premium to NAV as I write this, while STK’s 1.5% premium is smaller than the 10%+ premiums it’s had in the past, and is pretty close to trading at par.
So, yes, you can get Microsoft cheaper than you can by buying it with AIO (by the way, MSFT is 3.24% of AIO’s portfolio, its second-largest position). How? By buying STK!
But of course, these are still both premiums. Lucky for us, we can do even better, by purchasing a heavily _discounted_ CEF like the 9.4%-yielding **Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG),** a recommendation of my _CEF Insider_ service trading at a 7.9% discount to NAV, with Microsoft as its top position, at 4% of assets, followed by **NVIDIA (NVDA)** at 3.3%.
And check this out.
![CEF-Bargain](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67c9db1e0529753b554e2473/CEF-Bargain/960x0.png?format=png&width=144)
Swappable CEFs
Ycharts
See how ASG (in blue) is at that 7.9% discount as of this writing, while AIO (in purple) is at a 6.5% premium, but in 2020, ASG traded at a premium and AIO traded at a discount?
If you’re thinking there’s an opportunity here to buy ASG when it’s discounted, sell when it’s at a premium, then buy AIO when it’s at a discount and do the opposite trade when AIO swings to a premium, you’re right. This isn’t just what some niche hedge funds do. It’s also the kind of move we’re always looking to make at _CEF Insider_.

Outlook.com users are struggling to get emails on their iPhone
getty
Microsoft is struggling to get on top of a bug that has seen Outlook users unable to collect their email using the iPhone’s Mail app.
Problems were first reported early on March 4, with users unable to send or receive Outlook emails using the Mail app that’s built into iOS. And, at the time of writing at 11:15 ET, the problem remains unresolved.
“Users may be unable to access their email using the native mail app on iOS devices,” an update on reads. “We're continuing to investigate the underlying cause of why users attempting to access their email using the native mail app on iOS devices are impacted.”
It doesn’t look like the problem is likely to be resolved imminently, either, with Microsoft promising the next update by 3:30pm ET.
Users who cannot get the Mail app on their iPhone to work can still send and receive email by visiting Outlook.com in a web browser. It’s not clear whether iPads, which work on a variant of iOS, are also affected by the bug, which doesn’t appear to be affecting all Outlook.com users.
PROMOTED
Outlook.com is the modern version of Hotmail, which was once the most popular webmail service on the planet, before being superseded by Gmail.
## Microsoft Problems
The Outlook problems compound what’s been an unhappy week for Microsoft’s services. Over the weekend, Microsoft365 services, which include Outlook email, were disrupted by a botched update from the company. Services were down for more than an hour before the company confirmed that it had reversed a code change that gradually fixed the issue.
The ongoing Outlook issue appears to be unrelated to the weekend’s flaw.

HIMSS 2025, the global healthcare conference, has brought together 28,000 attendees this week, with AI taking center stage as it did at the ViVE event two weeks ago. Healthcare CIOs are zeroing in on the following areas to fuel innovation and upgrade their existing solutions. Here’s what's drawing their focus from the event.
## **Clinical Decision Making**
Microsoft booth had a large attendance following their of the Dragon Copilot. The company finally combines its voice dictation product with the ambient listening solution. Many healthcare provider organizations have both products, and this is an opportunity to consolidate them by having the products operate on a single platform. The Dragon Copilot announcement is another stickiness to the Microsoft ecosystem of Microsoft Fabric, Copilot Studio, and Azure AI Foundry. In my discussion with Microsoft, they have approximately thirty healthcare partners and are growing in their Copilot Studio platform.
One of the partners, Wolters Kluwer, the integration of its UpToDate solution with the healthcare agent service in Microsoft Copilot Studio. Greg Samios, President and CEO of Clinical Effectiveness for Wolters Kluwer Health said "Seconds can make all the difference in clinical decision making, and through our collaborations, we're focused on speed to the right answer wherever you are in the clinical workflow".
PROMOTED
Google Cloud announced new generative AI capabilities called Visual Q&A that will search tables, charts, and diagrams to process diverse patient data, medical images, and others to help provide a comprehensive view of the patient. Enterprise search within the EMR has improved dramatically with generative AI capabilities, and the EMR companies are partnering with their preferred cloud vendor to incorporate this feature. MEDITECH EMR has developed its AI-powered search within its Expanse product
Oracle similar capabilities in Q4 last year with its clinical AI agent that can handle patient queries.
MORE FOR YOU
Overall, every healthcare technology vendor is developing a solution incorporating generative AI to improve and speed up clinical decision-making.
## Patient Engagement
Ensuring patients are efficiently scheduled and seen by doctors is a top priority for healthcare providers. With high turnover in contact center staff, healthcare operations leaders are turning to automation to improve efficiency. As generative AI accelerates clinical decision-making, it also enhances contact centers by providing agents with instant patient information, leading to better interactions.
Webex has its Contact Center features with Epic’s Cheers module and Hyperdrive interface. With this integration, Webex agents can manage conversations directly within Epic, eliminating the need to switch between windows or systems. This streamlined workflow enhances efficiency and simplifies the contact center/patient interaction.
Similarly, RevSpring announced its virtual healthcare agent to enhance the patient and customer service staff experience. RevSpring president Nicole Rogas said, “By combining AI, data-driven insights, and personalized engagement, we empower patients to better understand their financial obligations, simplify billing and payments, and easily access financial assistance.”
The market is flooded with AI-powered virtual agents, all promising to transform patient interactions through phone, text, and online chat. These solutions tap into dynamic knowledge bases to answer questions, automate tasks, and enhance self-service options. While many will offer similar capabilities, the real differentiator lies in how effectively they reduce staff workload and refocus healthcare teams on patient care.
## Cybersecurity Scare
Cybersecurity keeps every healthcare leader on high alert. During the Vegas event, a client I advised faced a potential security scare. I got a call warning of a possible compromise. Fortunately, it turned out to be a false alarm, with no signs of an actual intrusion. The organization had received a similar to the one Arctic Wolf posted. Carter Groome, Chief Executive Officer of First Health Advisory, a veteran in the information security space, said, "We’ve seen a significant uptick in phishing, brute force, and social engineering attacks in the last couple of weeks." This trend will continue, and it will not stop.
Healthcare CIOs continue strengthening their security posture while keeping up with the HIPAA updates. It will be interesting if the guidelines from the previous administration on HIPAA will stay. Carter Groome said, “I'm not sure if that will even be considered, but if healthcare entities need the government to guide them on how to protect their business, they have bigger issues.”
HIMSS 2025 had great energy on the show floor, with new product announcements everywhere. Zafar Chaudry, Chief Digital Officer & Chief AI and Information Officer at Seattle Children's Hospital, summed it up and said, “At HIMSS 2025, AI and efficiency took center stage, fueling the next wave of healthcare transformation.”
The question remains about how many of these products healthcare organizations will adopt and whether they will help them provide quality care at a lower cost.

These companies' strategic positioning, financial strength and technological advantages suggest they ... [+] may be well-equipped to deliver long-term value as the artificial intelligence landscape evolves.
getty
is rapidly transforming industries throughout the global economy, accelerating innovation. The Stargate AI Project is one of the most ambitious technological initiatives, promising to revolutionize how AI systems communicate, share resources and scale across different platforms and applications. For investors seeking to capitalize on this leap forward, identifying companies positioned to benefit from Stargate's implementation could provide significant growth opportunities in the coming years.
This analysis examines five top AI stocks poised to gain substantial momentum as the Stargate AI Project approaches realization. These companies have been selected based on their technological capabilities, strategic positioning, financial strength and potential to capture value from the next evolution in artificial intelligence infrastructure. Getting ahead of these opportunities now may provide a first-mover advantage in what could become the next major catalyst in the AI investment landscape.
## **What Is The Stargate AI Project?**
The Stargate AI Project represents a groundbreaking framework for creating interconnected AI systems that communicate and share resources across previously incompatible platforms and architectures. At its core, Stargate aims to establish a universal protocol for interacting AI models, enabling different machine learning systems to leverage each other's capabilities without custom integration work. This innovation promises to eliminate the siloed nature of current AI development, significantly reducing redundancy in model training and enabling more powerful composite applications.

The implications for the AI market are profound, as Stargate potentially addresses one of the industry's most persistent challenges: fragmentation. By creating a standardized interface for AI systems to connect and collaborate, the project could dramatically accelerate development cycles while reducing costs. Stargate represents both an opportunity and a strategic imperative for companies involved in AI infrastructure, model development or applications that rely on artificial intelligence capabilities. The firms that successfully position themselves within this emerging ecosystem stand to capture disproportionate value as the technology matures and gains widespread adoption.
## **Criteria Used For These Top AI Stock Picks**
The selection methodology for these AI stock recommendations prioritizes companies with demonstrated technological leadership and strategic positioning to benefit specifically from the Stargate AI Project's implementation. Primary consideration was given to firms actively contributing to interoperability standards or developing technologies that align with Stargate's core mission of creating a unified AI infrastructure. Each company needed to show general AI capabilities and specific initiatives or technology stacks that would gain a competitive advantage from more interconnected AI systems.
MORE FOR YOU
Financial stability and growth metrics were equally important in the selection process. Companies chosen demonstrate strong revenue growth trajectories, sustainable margins and sufficient capital resources to fund ongoing R&D investments required to maintain technological leadership. Valuation considerations balanced current multiples against projected growth rates, with preference given to companies offering reasonable entry points relative to their long-term potential. Additionally, each firm's market positioning, management quality and history of successful innovation were evaluated to ensure they possess the organizational capabilities to capitalize on the opportunities Stargate will create in the artificial intelligence landscape.
## **5 Top AI Stocks to Buy Ahead of the Stargate AI Project**
## **1. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)**
### **NVIDIA Business Overview**
has cemented its position as the undisputed leader in GPU technology, powering the world's most advanced AI systems. The company's graphics processing units have become the industry standard for training and running large language models and other sophisticated AI applications. Beyond hardware, NVIDIA has developed CUDA, a comprehensive software ecosystem that optimizes performance for AI workloads and serves as the foundation for thousands of AI applications. This hardware-software integration creates a formidable competitive advantage that widens as AI adoption accelerates across industries.
The company's dominance extends beyond consumer applications into data centers, where its H100 and upcoming GPU architectures deliver unprecedented computational power for enterprise AI deployments. NVIDIA's strategic shift toward positioning itself as an end-to-end AI platform provider rather than merely a chip manufacturer has allowed it to capture increasing value from the AI boom. Through consistent investment in R&D and strategic acquisitions, NVIDIA continues to expand its technological lead while building the critical infrastructure that will underpin the next generation of AI applications.
### **Why NVDA Stock Is A Top Choice**
NVIDIA stands to benefit tremendously from the Stargate AI Project due to its central position in the AI computation infrastructure landscape.

### **Palantir Business Overview**
specializes in data integration, analytics and AI-powered decision support platforms for complex, high-stakes environments. The company offers two primary platforms: Gotham, which serves government and defense customers, and Foundry, which targets commercial enterprises across manufacturing, healthcare and financial services. Both platforms excel at integrating disparate data sources into cohesive, actionable intelligence using sophisticated AI algorithms. What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on "AI for the real world" – building systems that combine human judgment with machine learning to solve concrete operational problems rather than pursuing general artificial intelligence.
The company has demonstrated remarkable success in securing government contracts, including significant work with defense and intelligence agencies, providing a stable revenue base with high switching costs once implemented. Palantir's commercial business has gained momentum more recently, with particular strength in industries dealing with complex physical operations and supply chains. The company's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) represents its most direct play in the generative AI space, allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance. This "private AI" approach addresses critical data security and intellectual property concerns that have limited enterprise AI adoption.
### **Why PLTR Stock Is A Top Choice**
Palantir is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the Stargate AI Project due to its specialized expertise in integrating disparate systems and data sources – precisely the capability essential for organizations seeking to implement Stargate's vision of interconnected AI. As the Stargate framework enables more AI systems to communicate and share capabilities, the complexity of managing these interactions within regulated, security-conscious environments will increase dramatically. Palantir's proven ability to build mission-critical systems that maintain governance while enabling powerful analytics creates a natural entry point for the company to become a key implementation partner for Stargate deployments.
The company's AIP offering already demonstrates Palantir's understanding of the need to connect proprietary data with external AI capabilities – a microcosm of what Stargate aims to achieve at a broader scale. This early positioning in the "AI orchestration" market suggests Palantir could emerge as a critical middleware layer in the Stargate ecosystem, helping organizations safely expose their data to interconnected AI systems while maintaining security and compliance. With accelerating commercial adoption, improving financial metrics, and a long track record of successfully implementing complex systems integration projects, Palantir represents a somewhat higher-risk but potentially higher-reward opportunity to invest in the infrastructure layer that will make Stargate's promise of interconnected AI a practical reality for enterprises and government agencies.
Palantir Technologies saw its stock surge in early February 2025 after strong earnings, only to retreat sharply as concerns over potential U.S. defense spending cuts weighed on investor sentiment. The stock initially spiked to record highs but has since tumbled 30%, with accelerating selling momentum pushing it toward key support levels. Despite the pullback, PLTR remains 17% higher year-to-date and has quadrupled in the past year, reflecting strong long-term performance. Analysts are split—some see the sell-off as a buying opportunity, given Palantir’s role in federal data initiatives. At the same time, technical indicators suggest further downside risk if support near $85, $66, and $44 fails to hold. Investors should watch for a potential recovery toward $100 and $125 if momentum shifts.
## Bottom Line
The Stargate AI Project represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence architecture that could dramatically accelerate AI capabilities by enabling previously isolated systems to work together seamlessly. The five companies profiled – NVIDIA, Microsoft, Google, AMD and Palantir – each offer distinct advantages for investors looking to position themselves ahead of this technological evolution. From NVIDIA's dominance in AI hardware to Microsoft's enterprise software integration, Google's fundamental AI research leadership, AMD's competitive computing solutions and Palantir's expertise in complex systems integration, these firms provide complementary exposures to different aspects of the AI value chain that Stargate aims to revolutionize. While valuations remain elevated across the AI sector, these companies' strategic positioning, financial strength and technological advantages suggest they may be well-equipped to deliver long-term value as the artificial intelligence landscape evolves.

Innovation is the heart of the company.
getty
At its core, is about survival.
The world is littered with companies that dominated their industries in their day, only to be blindsided by disruption that they themselves could have been a part of, but for one reason or another missed.
Kodak invented the digital camera but clung to film. Nokia once commanded the mobile phone market before failing to pivot to smartphones. AI has been around for decades, yet most of the corporate world slept on investing in it until OpenAI launched ChatGPT and reset the competitive landscape overnight.
PROMOTED
The corporate landscape is an unforgiving place, where past performance indicates a future decline more often than continued success.
If you don’t build a practice of innovation into your company’s DNA, the world will innovate around you, and eventually, without you.
But how do you create a structured approach to innovation, rather than just relying on one-off moments of inspiration?
The wrong way to go about things is to treat innovation as an initiative, something to launch when market pressures mount. The more effective way to think about innovation is to perceive it as an ongoing process that requires a mix of culture, leadership, and sustained . Here’s how to get started.
MORE FOR YOU
## **Three Key Principles for Making Innovation Stick**
To make innovation work within an organization, three key principles stand out: treating innovation as a process rather than an event, ensuring strong facilitation, and committing to sustained exploration rather than one-off breakthroughs. A common mistake companies make is treating innovation as a one-time initiative rather than an ongoing discipline. True innovation isn’t about launching a flashy program when competitors pull ahead; instead, it embeds a structured system for experimentation, learning from failure, and iterating rapidly.
Another misconception companies have is with the concept of failure. If you already knew it would work, it wouldn’t be innovation.
Failing at innovation is experimentation, while failure to innovate is corporate suicide. This is why companies that innovate successfully build mechanisms that allow ideas to be tested, adjusted, and refined over time, rather than expecting every initiative to be a breakthrough or to have an ROI attached to them.
Nicholas Lalla, in , highlights a critical challenge many organizations face in approaching innovation with these lessons in mind: an ingrained resistance to risk.
Large corporations are designed to optimize existing operations, not to explore the unknown. This is where external catalysts, such as economic development organizations and startup ecosystems, can play a critical role. Nicholas argues that innovation doesn’t always have to come from within. Instead, companies can look to structured partnerships, whether through incubators, universities, or local entrepreneurship networks, to bring fresh ideas into their ecosystems without the full burden of risk.
“Companies often resist new ideas not because they don’t see the value, but because they don’t have an internal culture that supports exploration,” Nicholas explains.
“That’s where intermediaries come in. They de-risk the process, guide companies through experimentation, and help them tap into innovation that they might otherwise ignore,” he continues.
The organizations that will thrive in the coming decades aren’t those that occasionally launch a moonshot, but those that systematically explore, test, and refine ideas over time. Nicholas’ insight about what he calls “innovation sherpas” reflects a broader truth: innovation requires companies to rethink their appetite for uncertainty, and often this is best done together.
"Innovation Sherpas help bridge the gap between corporate inertia and the agility of startups," Nicholas continues.
"They provide a structured way for companies to engage in experimentation without disrupting core operations. The key is to make innovation a guided process, rather than an isolated event."
This principle has proven true not just in the world of corporate innovation, but in city and regional economic development as well. As Nicholas highlights in _Reinventing the Heartland_ , cities that build strong entrepreneurial ecosystems aren’t those that blindly chase startups, but those that embed innovation into their existing industries. The same logic applies to companies: innovation should be integrated into existing structures rather than treated as an outside initiative.
## **Innovation Needs Champions—Why Facilitation Is Critical**
Innovation doesn’t come on-demand, and not everyone is supposed to magically turn into an innovator. Instead, innovation thrives in the presence of champions who can translate ideas into execution and support those who are ready to jump in, even if they never innovate a thing themselves.
Facilitators can come in many forms: visionary executives, internal innovation leaders, or external 'innovation sherpas' who guide companies through the transformation process.
Microsoft’s approach to innovation offers a compelling model for how facilitation should work. Rather than leaving innovation to a siloed R&D department, Microsoft has built a culture where employees across all levels of the organization are encouraged to experiment. The emphasizes the need for structured collaboration, executive champions, and intentional discovery as essential elements in keeping a company innovative.
"Innovation isn’t a flash of genius from the C-suite or any individual—it’s a craft and a culture," say JoAnn Garbin and Dean Carignan, two Microsofties and the co-authors of the book.
"The role of leadership isn’t to have all the answers—it’s to build an environment where the right questions get asked and explored," JoAnn and Dean explain. "Innovation flourishes when everyone is empowered to experiment, collaborate, and challenge assumptions without fear of failure." the duo explains.
Their insight highlights a critical gap in how many companies approach innovation.
Too often, organizations look to senior leaders or external consultants to drive change, when in reality, the best ideas often come from employees who see inefficiencies and opportunities firsthand.
One of Microsoft’s most effective mechanisms for fostering innovation is _Microsoft Garage_ , an internal incubator where employees can experiment with new ideas outside of their formal job descriptions. The Garage exemplifies four key principles, or patterns, of innovation that JoAnn and Dean note in their book, namely
  1. **Innovate every day** : Make innovation part of daily work, not just a special initiative.
  2. **Innovate with everyone** : Encourage participation from all employees, not just designated innovators.
  3. **Innovate over the years** : Commit to long-term exploration rather than expecting overnight breakthroughs.
  4. **Innovate more than technology: Reinforce the incentives and structures that go beyond the technology and acknowledge that humans are at the center of innovation.**


Microsoft’s approach to innovation perfectly illustrates the three principles of commitment, facilitation, and sustainment. It provides a platform for continuous innovation, where employees can test and refine ideas over years, not just in bursts of activity.
The lessons from Microsoft extend beyond corporate settings to regional economic strategies as well. Nicholas Lalla highlights in _Reinventing the Heartland_ that one of the most common mistakes cities make when trying to foster entrepreneurship is treating it as a short-term project rather than a long-term investment.
“Successful entrepreneurial ecosystems aren’t built overnight,” Nicholas explains. “They require sustained commitment, a willingness to iterate, and an understanding that meaningful change happens over years, not quarters.”
The biggest challenge companies face isn’t coming up with ideas, it’s committing to them long enough to see results. Many organizations abandon projects too early, expecting immediate ROI. But as the authors of these two books note, real innovation takes time and persistence.
If competition is a game of survival then innovation is how to play it. And the best way to succeed in it is with sustained investment in learning, adaptation, and strategic alignment.
Whether you’re in tech, manufacturing, finance, or any other industry, innovation isn’t optional. Instead, it’s the price of staying relevant. The good news is that you don’t have to figure it out alone. From economic development organizations acting as "innovation sherpas" to structured corporate programs like Microsoft’s, the roadmap for embedding innovation into your company is clearer than ever. Only one question remains: when will you take the first step?

Cloud computing startup CoreWeave’s three cofounders—Michael Intrator, Brian Venturo and Brannin McBee—and board member Jack Cogen are now billionaires, _Forbes_ estimates, according to information revealed about their stakes and private market sales in the company’s initial public offering prospectus filed Monday.
CEO Intrator, Chief Strategy Officer Venturo and Chief Development Officer McBee own 15%, 9% and 7% of CoreWeave’s shares, respectively, while Cogen owns 5%. CoreWeave hasn’t yet priced its public stock offering, but based on a private market sale of some CoreWeave shares in October that implied a valuation of around $20 billion, the four men hold stakes in CoreWeave’s worth more than $1 billion each. They’ve also cashed out more than the typical pre-IPO founder does: the three cofounders and Cogen each sold more than $150 million of CoreWeave’s shares (before taxes) as part of private market sales in 2023 and 2024.
Per _Forbes’_ estimates, Intrator is now worth $3.1 billion, Venturo is worth $2 billion, McBee is worth $1.5 billion and Cogen is worth $1.2 billion. A spokesperson for CoreWeave did not respond to a request for comment.
CoreWeave’s cofounders didn’t expect to create . In 2017, the three then-commodity traders had amassed a stockpile of Nvidia chips to mine cryptocurrency for their new company, Atlantic Crypto. Two years later, they renamed it CoreWeave and shifted the business model to building data centers and selling computing power to companies that didn’t have enough of their own GPU servers–storage systems comprised of electronic circuits called Graphics Processing Units. After OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022 and unleashed something of an AI firestorm, CoreWeave’s customers were, increasingly, AI companies. Now, according to the company’s new filing, CoreWeave’s biggest customers are Microsoft, IBM, Meta, NVIDIA and billion-dollar AI labs Cohere and Mistral.
“What we did is we said, ‘Hey, there's a new and emergent way that compute is going to be used in the future,” Intrator _Forbes_ in 2024. “What are they going to need to be as successful as possible?’”

As the demand for GPUs grew, CoreWeave found itself in the right place at the right time. As the result of several rounds of investments, its valuation ballooned from around $2 billion in May 2023 to $19 billion in May 2024—and, according to Reuters, it may aim for a Revenue, too, spiked, from $230 million in 2023 to $1.92 billion in 2024, per the IPO filing. But so did net losses, which grew nearly 50% to $860 million in 2024. It’s expensive to build data centers, and CoreWeave has 32 of them running more than 250,000 GPUs as of the end of 2024.
CoreWeave’s cofounders are all billionaires in part because of the company’s massive valuation, which could make it one of the biggest IPOs since public markets slowed in 2022. But they were also able to retain enough of the company’s shares because they didn’t raise as much equity funding as a typical venture-backed tech company. According to the filing, CoreWeave raised $14.5 billion in funding over 12 financings—but more than two-thirds was debt. CoreWeave’s latest big funding round, for example, was a $7.6 billion debt round led asset managers Magnetar, CoreWeave’s first and biggest backer, and Blackstone; per the IPO document, it was “one of the largest private debt financings in history.” Another CoreWeave investor of note: the Victoria’s Secret billionaire who stepped down from his company L Brands in 2020 amid scrutiny over his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and played a crucial role in one of the He now owns a 4.4% stake in the company via the Linden West Trust, which was set up for Wexner’s descendants.
CoreWeave faces deep-pocketed competition, particularly from cloud providers such as Microsoft’s Azure and Amazon’s Amazon Web Services (AWS). CoreWeave’s future also depends especially heavily on one customer: In 2024, more than 60% of its revenue came from Microsoft, which has leaned on CoreWeave amid its struggles to get enough GPU capacity for its customers. Although Microsoft plans to spend $10 billion on CoreWeave servers through 2030, according to , its CEO Satya Nadella said that external sources of processing power and storage (aka “compute”) like CoreWeave are a “one-time” band-aid, speaking on the BG2 in December. In the meantime, Microsoft’s own cloud provider, Azure, is working to “get caught up with demand,” he added.

With AI, innovation isn’t just measured in raw computational power—it’s about creating systems that can reshape markets. The DeepSeek R1 paper has for its novel approach to training large language models (LLMs), demonstrating advanced reasoning through a streamlined reinforcement learning (RL) process.
Yet, as LLMs become increasingly commoditized, deeper questions arise: How will companies like OpenAI, Anthropic and their peers sustain value? Can closed models build a winning ecosystem reminiscent of the Windows era?
PROMOTED
## A Deeper Look At DeepSeek R1
DeepSeek R1 represents a breakthrough in model training with a focus on efficiency and emergent reasoning, though information about the model is still coming out and some experts have about the technology.
Rather than relying heavily on supervised fine-tuning, DeepSeek R1 introduces a variant called that is trained predominantly using RL. By rewarding the model not just for correct answers but also for a transparent, step-by-step reasoning process, the approach encourages what many call a “” methodology.
In essence, the model is prompted to “think out loud,” which helps in breaking down complex problems into manageable steps.
After this initial phase, DeepSeek R1 undergoes a concise round of fine-tuning to polish its responses and improve clarity. One of the most exciting aspects of the project is its ability to distill these advanced reasoning capabilities into . This would mean that the sophisticated problem-solving skills developed in the giant model can be effectively transferred to lighter versions, potentially making cutting-edge AI more democratic and available to a wider range of developers.
## The Commoditization Of LLMs
The rapid evolution of models like DeepSeek R1 is occurring alongside a broader trend: LLMs are quickly becoming a commodity, as and others have pointed out. Today’s market is witnessing an explosion of high-performing language models—both proprietary and open source.
This democratization means that the raw technology is less of a competitive advantage than it once was.
When multiple players can offer comparable performance, the unique value of any single model diminishes. Instead, success now hinges on how these models are applied. The focus is shifting from having a powerful engine to creating value-added services and user experiences that leverage that engine.
Standardized APIs and common training methodologies further lower the barrier to entry, making it easier for companies to switch between providers or integrate multiple models into their workflows.
## Accruing Value In A Crowded Market
In this new landscape, traditional model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are . With foundational models quickly becoming interchangeable, the battle for market share is shifting to the application layer. Here’s how these companies are positioning themselves for long-term success:
**• Proprietary Data And Fine-Tuning:** While the base models are available to everyone, companies that can leverage unique, proprietary data to fine-tune their models stand to gain a competitive edge. Customization tailored to specific industries or tasks can offer superior performance that generic models simply can’t match.
**• Integrated Platforms And Services:** Rather than simply providing API access, these companies are building full-fledged platforms. OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude, for example, are not just models—they’re part of broader ecosystems that offer analytics, safety features and robust customer support. These integrated solutions are far more attractive to enterprises looking for end-to-end solutions.
**• User Experience And Ecosystem Lock-In:** The goal isn’t just to power applications but to become the de facto standard for them. By building intuitive, customer-facing applications, AI companies can capture greater value. When a user interacts with a polished, all-in-one product, the underlying model becomes secondary. This is a strategy reminiscent of how Microsoft leveraged Windows to become an essential part of the computing ecosystem.
## Drawing Parallels With Windows And Office
The most compelling parallel is with Microsoft’s strategy in the personal computer era. Microsoft didn’t just offer an operating system; it bundled Windows with the Office suite, creating an ecosystem that locked in users and developers alike. This synergy between a platform and its applications generated powerful network effects and established a high barrier to entry for competitors.
For AI, the lesson is clear: Owning the customer interface is critical. A closed-source model that remains solely a backend service risks being undercut by open-source alternatives. However, if that model is paired with a strong application—something that seamlessly integrates into daily workflows—it can command a premium.
The integrated ecosystem approach means that even if the underlying AI is commoditized, the user experience can create a moat around the product.
## The Ecosystem Question
The path to ecosystem dominance is not without its challenges. The nature of AI makes switching costs relatively low compared to the era of desktop software. Developers can often swap out one LLM for another with minimal disruption, thanks to standardized APIs and shared performance benchmarks. Furthermore, the collaborative spirit in the AI research community accelerates innovation, meaning that any proprietary advantage is likely to be short-lived.
The critical question remains: Can closed-source AI providers build an ecosystem robust enough to rival the enduring dominance of Windows and Office?
If the future of AI is to mirror past successes, companies must go beyond merely offering a high-performing model. They must create compelling, user-friendly applications that become indispensable in everyday workflows, capturing and sustaining value even as the technology itself becomes widely available.
## Conclusion

Apple is no stranger to entering markets later than its competitors, only to dominate them with superior design and excellent user experience. As rumors swirl about the company's potential entry into the folding smartphone and smart glasses markets, it raises an intriguing question: Could Apple's next big move reshape the augmented reality landscape and revolutionize wearable tech once again?
Last week, long-time Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote a detailed that predicted Apple’s potential folding iPhone. Although the article is speculative, he shares details of what might be in a future Apple folding phone. I wonder if he has sources inside Apple or if one of its suppliers is feeding him these details. He suggests the specs will be locked in by the end of 2025, and we could see the first generation of an Apple folding phone by late 2026.
To be clear, Apple has said nothing about making a folding phone. Indeed, the market for folding phones today is relatively small. According to , 17.7 million were sold globally in 2024. Compare this to the number of smartphones sold in 2024, which was , and the folding smartphone market is minimal.
PROMOTED
I have begun thinking about how Apple’s entrance into the smart glasses market has the potential to reshape not only the augmented reality landscape but also the broader technology industry. With Apple's proven track record of refining emerging technologies and making them mainstream, their foray into this space could have far-reaching implications for hardware innovation, software ecosystems, and consumer adoption.
## The Current Smart Glasses Landscape
Before diving into Apple’s potential impact, it’s crucial to understand the current state of smart glasses. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta have all made strides in AR hardware. Despite its commercial failure, Google Glass paved the way for enterprise-focused AR devices. Microsoft's HoloLens has gained traction in the industrial and medical fields, while Meta's Ray-Ban Stories aim for a more fashion-forward, consumer-friendly approach. However, these devices have struggled to break into the mass market. Challenges such as bulky designs, limited app ecosystems, short battery life, and high price points have kept smart glasses mainly in the realm of early adopters and niche users.

## Enter Apple: The Game Changer
Apple adopts a systematic approach to new technology markets. Apple typically does not rush into these areas; instead, it takes time to observe and analyze before entering when it is confident it can transform the product category. This strategy has proven successful repeatedly, evident in the iPhone’s transformation of the smartphone landscape, the Apple Watch's leadership in wearables, and the widespread cultural impact of AirPods.
So, how might Apple impact the smart glasses market?
1. Design and User Experience
Apple's design philosophy emphasizes sleekness, simplicity, and user-friendliness — all critical for smart glasses to achieve mainstream appeal. Current AR glasses often sacrifice aesthetics for functionality. Still, Apple's expertise in balancing both could result in a product that looks and feels like regular eyewear while packing powerful AR features.
Apple's rumored smart glasses, expected to integrate seamlessly with the iPhone, could reduce hardware bulk by offloading processing tasks to the smartphone. This design would improve battery life and allow for a more lightweight and comfortable design—a key barrier to adoption that Apple is well-equipped to overcome.
2. Ecosystem Integration
One of Apple's most substantial competitive advantages is its ecosystem. With millions of users already invested in the Apple universe—from iPhones and iPads to Macs and Apple Watches—the company can create a seamless AR experience. Imagine receiving notifications, accessing maps, or translating languages in real time, all through a pair of Apple glasses that sync effortlessly with your other devices.
Apple's robust App Store and ARKit platform would also benefit developers. By providing familiar development tools, Apple can jumpstart an app ecosystem for smart glasses, compelling users to buy the new hardware.
3. Consumer Awareness and Demand
Perhaps the most significant impact Apple could have is mainstreaming smart glasses. The company's brand power and marketing prowess have a history of turning niche products into mass-market sensations. When Apple adopts a technology, it signals to the public that the technology is ready for prime time.
With smart glasses, this could mean a shift from seeing AR eyewear as a futuristic gimmick to an essential tech accessory — much like the transition from Bluetooth headsets to stylish, ubiquitous AirPods.
4. Content and Applications
Beyond hardware, Apple's push into AR glasses will likely catalyze content creation. Its focus on AR apps for iPhones has already laid the groundwork, and smart glasses could open new opportunities for immersive experiences in gaming, education, health, and commerce.
For example, imagine a new wave of AR games where digital characters interact with your physical environment or real-time language translation that appears as subtitles right in your field of view. Apple's relationships with content creators and developers could spark a flood of innovative applications tailored for smart glasses. Expect some hints of this at its World Wide Developers Conference, typically scheduled in June.
5. Market Ripple Effects
Apple’s entry into the augmented reality market will likely exert significant pressure on competitors such as Meta, Google, and Microsoft, compelling them to expedite their AR initiatives. Anticipate faster innovation cycles and increased R&D investments industry-wide. Additionally, Apple's commitment to user privacy may set new industry benchmarks for AR data management, particularly given the sensitive aspects associated with cameras and sensors within eyewear, driving the market towards more transparent and secure AR experiences.
## The Road Ahead
Despite Apple's potential to revolutionize smart glasses, challenges remain. Battery life, field of view limitations, and pricing will all need careful consideration. Moreover, the public perception around wearing technology on one's face—a barrier that Google Glass famously stumbled over—must be tactfully addressed.
However, if history is any guide, Apple has a knack for solving these technical challenges and crafting a narrative that makes its products desirable, even necessary.
Apple’s potential entrance into the smart glasses market would be more than just a product launch — it's a possible paradigm shift for augmented reality and wearable technology. By leveraging its design expertise, ecosystem strength, and brand influence, Apple could transform smart glasses from a niche gadget into a must-have accessory. In doing so, they would push the entire tech industry forward, spurring innovation and reshaping how we interact with digital content and the physical world. If Apple enters the smart glasses market, the future of AR glasses will be much more interesting.
While Apple’s history of dominating late-entered markets is compelling, it’s crucial to note that no official announcements have been made regarding a folding iPhone or smart glasses. Speculations from analysts remain just that, with no concrete product plans disclosed by Apple.

AI Innovation Requires More Women at the Table.
Lalena Kennedy via Canva
Artificial intelligence is reshaping industries, economies, and daily life, but its roots run deeper than the breakthroughs of today’s tech giants. Women make up 50% of the global consumer market, yet AI products often fail to meet their needs because those developing the technology do not reflect their experiences. If AI is to be an effective business tool, it must be built by those who truly understand its customers. This oversight isn’t merely an equity issue—it's a missed business opportunity.
## Understanding Women Means Capturing Market Value
In business, understanding your customers is everything. AI thrives by accurately predicting consumer behaviors, delivering personalized experiences, and meeting market demands. Without diverse leadership and developers, companies risk creating AI solutions misaligned with women's needs, ultimately losing market share and profitability.
PROMOTED
Consider voice recognition technology, foundational to virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa. Early algorithms trained predominantly on male speech patterns often , frustrating users, delaying adoption, and resulting in expensive product fixes. Understanding and including women's perspectives from the start could have prevented these costs.
## **Real Costs, Real Consequences: The Healthcare Example**
Healthcare vividly illustrates the risks and costs associated with excluding women from AI development. One notable example involved an AI diagnostic tool for heart disease that initially failed to recognize symptoms commonly seen in women because it relied heavily on male-dominated datasets. Hospitals faced costly retraining, regulatory challenges, and compromised patient outcomes due to missed diagnoses. In fact, a revealed AI systems predicting liver disease from blood tests were twice as likely to overlook the disease in women as in men, a severe oversight rooted in gender-biased data.
MORE FOR YOU
Similarly troubling, these flaws are more than technical—they are life-threatening, expensive mistakes that underscore the real-world implications of lacking gender diversity in AI development.
Conversely, initiatives led by women, like developed at MIT and Google, demonstrate the immense value of inclusive perspectives. These targeted diagnostic tools, specifically designed with women's physiology in mind, have substantially improved early detection, saved lives, and reduced healthcare costs. Such examples illustrate the power and necessity of integrating diverse voices into AI leadership.
## **Fintech’s Untapped Opportunity**
In financial services, AI-driven tools must consider distinct ways women manage money, access credit, and invest. Traditional AI lending models often overlook women's financial behaviors, limiting capital access for women entrepreneurs and depriving financial institutions of significant profit opportunities.
Yet are changing this narrative, developing AI-powered platforms explicitly designed for women's financial realities. Tailored credit analysis tools, investment platforms, and financial planning applications developed with women's financial habits in mind have already demonstrated strong market traction. These innovations don't simply benefit women; they also present substantial untapped revenue streams for banks and fintech firms. Women-led fintech is a savvy business move.
## **Diversity in Data: Beyond Ethics to Economic Success**
It's tempting to frame AI diversity simply as an ethical imperative, but its primary benefit is economic. Diverse AI teams inherently have broader perspectives, leading to richer, more accurate data models. This means fewer costly fixes, less market friction, and higher consumer adoption.
Importantly, advocating for inclusive AI isn't limited to women. Many men in AI recognize that accurate data diversity translates directly into better business outcomes. Diverse perspectives and experiences drive more accurate predictions, relevant products, and stronger customer engagement, delivering real-world profitability.
Women-led teams at tech giants such as Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI have shown remarkable results by fine-tuning AI-driven customer insights, creating intuitive products that resonate deeply with female consumers. These products not only sell better, they redefine markets. AI designed with diverse leadership perspectives is both ethically sound and strategically superior.
To leverage this competitive advantage fully, businesses must prioritize funding women-founded AI startups, which currently receive only a fraction of venture capital investment despite often delivering higher returns on investment. Investing strategically in women-led AI businesses is not philanthropy—it's an investment in growth, innovation, and profitability.
## **AI Must Reflect Society to Serve It**
As AI increasingly influences decisions in healthcare, finance, and consumer technology, businesses cannot afford to overlook the insights of half their market. Companies that understand and anticipate the needs of all consumers will dominate the next wave of AI-driven innovations. Those failing to do so risk obsolescence and market irrelevance.
The future of artificial intelligence will be defined by its leaders. Ensuring women are among them isn’t just fair—it's essential for capturing value, driving growth, and sustaining competitive advantage. Embracing diversity at every AI decision-making level positions businesses to lead in a rapidly evolving marketplace.

Welcome back to The Prompt,
Scale AI cofounder Lucy Guo is embroiled in controversy after her second startup, a content creator platform called Passes, was sued for allegedly hosting child sexual abuse material, reported. The lesser known platform attracted young creators, promising them a means to earn money at a time when other platforms wouldn’t facilitate the same. Alec Celestin, a talent manager associated with Guo, allegedly encouraged the plaintiff to upload explicit content to the platform before her 18th birthday and the suit also alleged that the company’s employees helped her override the platform's safety checks to do so. Guo has denied the allegations.
Now let’s get into the headlines.
### **BIG PLAYS**
AI juggernaut **OpenAI launched****,** its **largest and most capable** model for chat to date, which it claims is better able to recognize patterns and draw conclusions as well as being**more natural to interact with**. OpenAI also said it expects the general purpose model to make up false information or **hallucinate less often** than its other models. The downside? CEO Sam Altman “it’s a giant, expensive model,” and extremely compute intensive. As a result, **OpenAI is “out of GPUs,”** he said and plans to add tens of thousands more in the coming weeks.
### **SHOW ME THE MONEY**
**Cloud computing behemoth****,** which sells access to its GPUs to AI companies, **has filed to go public.** According to an , the company**booked $1.92 billion in revenue** in 2024, but recorded net **losses of over $800 million**. The former bitcoin mining company runs about 250,000 GPUs across its 32 data centers and utilizes 360 MW of active power, it said in the filing. While CoreWeave customers include prominent AI model makers like Mistral, Meta and Cohere,**% of its revenue last year came from one client: Microsoft.** The rise of ChatGPT in 2022 sparked off an AI frenzy, bringing in a gold rush for companies like CoreWeave, which had ready access to ten of thousands of prized Nvidia chips.
### **AI DEALS OF THE WEEK**
**Anthropic has closed its $3.5 billion** massive **funding round,** which values it at**$61.5 billion,** according to . The company’s annual revenue run rate was about $1 billion last year as the business continues to grow rapidly. The deal was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. The deal has **minted seven new billionaires as****estimates** each cofounder holds at least 2% of the company’s equity.
## **DEEP DIVE**
Companies like OpenAI and Perplexity have made lofty claims that their AI-powered search engines, which scrape information from the web to generate summarized answers, will provide new sources of income for publishers by directing more readers to their sites. But the reality is starkly different —**AI search engines send 96% less referral traffic to news sites** and blogs than traditional Google search, per a new report by content licensing platform TollBit that was shared exclusively with _Forbes_. Meanwhile, AI developers’ **scraping of websites has more than doubled in recent months** , the report found.
OpenAI, Perplexity, Meta and other**AI companies scraped websites 2 million times on average** in the fourth quarter of last year, per the report, which analyzed 160 websites including national and local news, consumer tech and shopping blogs over the last three months of 2024. Each page was scraped about seven times on average.
“We are seeing an influx of bots that are hammering these sites every time a user asks a question,” CEO Toshit Panigrahi told _Forbes_. “The amount of demand for publisher content is nontrivial.” TollBit, which integrates with publishers to track scraping and charge AI companies each time they do so, collected the data from publishers that have signed up on its platform for analytics, giving it insight into traffic and scraping activity on their sites.
Last February, research firm Gartner that traffic from traditional search engines would drop 25% by 2026, largely due to AI chatbots and other virtual agents. Businesses that rely on search traffic have already started to take a hit. **Edtech company Chegg recently sued Google** , alleging that the search giant’s **AI-generated summaries** included content from its website without attribution,**snatching away eyeballs from its site and hurting its already diminishing revenue.** Chegg’s traffic plummeted 49% in January year-over-year, a sharp decline from the 8% drop in the second quarter last year, when Google released AI summaries. The traffic decline has affected Chegg to the extent that it is considering going private or getting acquired, CEO Nathan Schultz in an earnings call.
**“It’s time to say no,” Schultz told _Forbes_. **He said Google and publishers have long had a social contract to send users to high quality content, and not just retain that traffic on Google. “When you break that contract, that is not right.”
Read the full story on .
### **WEEKLY DEMO**
While tech giants like Microsoft, Meta and most recently, Amazon, which announced a more advanced version of Alexa, have gotten a leg up in the AI race, **Apple continues to struggle,** at _Bloomberg_ reported. Its **marquee voice assistant Siri has been lackluster** in comparison to other voice-based AI assistants and its suite of AI capabilities part of its Apple Intelligence that have been rolled out onto the latest iPhones **aren’t impressive enough** to sway users. The company’s progress has also been slowed by challenges with **leadership and attracting and retaining talent.**
### **MODEL BEHAVIOR**
**Pinterest is drowning in AI-generated slop** , reported. Multiple users have expressed frustration that the onslaught of AI imagery on the platform, known for its aesthetic mood boards and visual home and lifestyle inspiration ideas, **is “ruining” it.** A deluge of AI-generated images have spread across different categories like recipes, hairstyle inspiration and art, making it **difficult for people to find authentic human content.** Pinterest said in a statement that impressions on AI-generated content make up a small portion of total impressions and is working on ways to give users more control over the content they see on the platform.

In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, generative AI is revolutionizing the way businesses operate. To explore this transformation, I had the privilege of interviewing Professor Mohanbir Sawhney, Associate Dean for Digital Innovation at Northwestern Kellogg School of Management. As a leading expert in digital marketing, artificial intelligence applications, and business innovation, Professor Sawhney provided a comprehensive overview of how Gen AI is reshaping industries and the critical strategies businesses should adopt to maximize its potential.
Professor Sawhney emphasized that marketing, at its core, revolves around human interaction, making it a natural fit for generative AI. Unlike classical machine learning applications that rely on structured data, Gen AI thrives on conversational interactions, content generation, and dynamic engagement.
"When you look at the customer experience lifecycle—from insights and segmentation to offer creation, campaign execution, and performance analysis—generative AI enhances productivity and quality at every stage," he explained.
PROMOTED
For instance, businesses traditionally relied on structured customer surveys for insights, but now, AI-powered conversations can dynamically extract consumer sentiments in real-time. Likewise, platforms like Salesforce Einstein and Microsoft Copilot enable the automated creation of customer personas, targeted marketing campaigns, and hyper-personalized content.
To effectively integrate generative AI, Professor Sawhney suggests a two-by-two framework. AI can optimize internal workflows, such as automating meeting summaries and document analysis, or enhance customer-facing experiences, such as AI-powered chatbots for sales and support. Some applications provide immediate productivity gains, while others offer industry-specific, game-changing transformations.
For example, financial services may soon deploy AI-powered wealth advisors that provide personalized investment insights. Similarly, in retail, AI-driven digital twins could revolutionize e-commerce by autonomously negotiating purchases based on user preferences—ushering in an era of "bot-to-bot commerce."
Across industries, generative AI is addressing unique challenges and driving efficiencies. AI-powered image recognition tools can diagnose equipment malfunctions, reducing costly technician visits. Awiros, an India-based company, is using deep learning for video analytics to enhance field service efficiency in industries like HVAC and aerospace maintenance. AI-driven contract lifecycle management tools can generate, review, and negotiate contracts, enhancing efficiency. LawGeex, an Israel-based company, specializes in automated contract review, helping businesses streamline legal processes with AI. AI transcription tools can auto-populate electronic health records, streamlining doctor-patient interactions. Drones equipped with AI-powered image analysis can assess soil health, detect pests, and optimize harvesting schedules. AI models can evaluate post-disaster damages in real-time using aerial imagery, expediting claims processing.
Professor Sawhney stressed that these applications are not standalone solutions but part of a broader AI ecosystem, combining traditional machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI to deliver optimal results.
For startups, cost-effective AI adoption is crucial. "Instead of investing in an array of specialized tools, startups should choose a platform-based approach—leveraging AI capabilities within robust ecosystems like Salesforce, Adobe, or Microsoft Dynamics," he advised. By embedding AI into existing infrastructure, startups can avoid excessive subscription fees while ensuring scalability.
One of the most exciting aspects of generative AI is its potential to blur the line between "high-tech" and "high-touch" customer interactions. Professor Sawhney illustrated this with Mindbank AI, a startup developing AI-driven digital twins that learn user preferences and provide personalized mental health support. Such innovations have profound implications across industries, from AI-powered therapists to virtual financial advisors.
However, these advancements raise pressing ethical concerns. "The more AI knows about you, the greater the privacy risks. If a digital twin is hacked, it’s not just data theft—it’s identity theft at an unprecedented level," he warned. Establishing robust data security frameworks will be essential as AI-driven personalization expands.
As AI adoption accelerates, businesses must navigate complex legal and ethical landscapes. Key issues include intellectual property and copyright, as AI models are trained on vast datasets, often without clear attribution or compensation. AI models can perpetuate biases present in training data, necessitating rigorous oversight to prevent discriminatory outcomes. Inaccurate or misleading AI-generated content could have serious consequences, particularly in high-stakes fields like finance and healthcare. The EU AI Act classifies AI applications by risk level, with stricter compliance requirements for high-risk use cases. Future regulations will likely define global AI governance.
Professor Sawhney noted that while regulation is necessary, overly restrictive policies could stifle innovation. The challenge lies in striking the right balance between safety and progress.
Looking ahead, the pace of AI advancement is staggering. "By 2027, AI models will have the cognitive capabilities of PhD-level researchers," he predicted. Reports suggest that by 2026, over 20% of U.S. energy consumption will be dedicated to AI data centers—raising concerns about sustainability and infrastructure readiness.
The long-term impact of generative AI will depend not just on technological breakthroughs but also on society’s ability to manage change responsibly. The key challenges will include workforce reskilling, cost-benefit optimization, and establishing ethical AI governance.
For students and early-career professionals, Professor Sawhney emphasized three key areas. Understanding core disciplines like linear algebra, statistics, and computer science is essential to leveraging AI effectively. Actively using AI tools will provide hands-on experience and practical knowledge. As AI democratizes knowledge, critical thinking, and inquiry skills will become more valuable than rote memorization.
"The biggest asset a young person can have is curiosity. In a world where AI can generate answers, the key differentiator will be knowing the right questions to ask," he concluded.
Generative AI is not just another technological advancement—it represents a paradigm shift in how businesses operate, how customers engage, and how industries evolve. As AI capabilities continue to grow exponentially, companies must strategically integrate AI into their workflows while navigating ethical and regulatory challenges. The future is uncertain, but one thing is clear: AI is here to stay, and its impact will be transformative.
With insights from Professor Sawhney, it is evident that responsible AI adoption, continuous learning, and ethical foresight will define the next era of business innovation.

Quantum computing promises to revolutionize industries from AI to drug discovery, but significant ... [+] engineering challenges remain before we see practical applications.
Adobe Stock
From where we're sitting today, it's increasingly likely that quantum computing will be one of the most disruptive technologies on the medium-term horizon.
Here’s why: Harnessing the properties of matter as it behaves at the sub-atomic level – by taking advantage of strange phenomena like entanglement and superposition means certain types of computation can be vastly accelerated.
These include:
  * Identifying patterns across vast data sets
  * Solving complex optimization problems involving many variables
  * Cryptographic encryption for encoding and decoding information


Solving vital real-world challenges such as artificial intelligence, drug and materials discovery, and cyber security all rely on these calculations. So, the impact of quantum computing is likely to be immense.
There are some, though, who believe the reality is still some way off. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s views on this recently in the stock price of quantum computing providers. His belief is that “very useful quantum computers” could be 30 years away.
PROMOTED
On the other hand, evidence shows that quantum computing is increasingly accessible. Most of the big cloud providers—Google, Amazon, Microsoft—offer quantum-as-a-service, along with a growing ecosystem of startups and disruptors such as D-Wave and IonQ.
So, what’s the difference between what’s available today and what will be available when quantum becomes really useful?
## **Today’s Quantum Computers – The NISQ Era**
MORE FOR YOU
Although they’re incredible feats of engineering, quantum computers today are plagued by a number of limitations. For this reason, the current era of quantum computing is dubbed the (NISQ) era. Although improvements and breakthroughs are being made constantly, systems that are accessible today suffer from low fault tolerance, high rates of error caused by qubits decaying out of their quantum state, and extreme sensitivity to interference.
Most systems still rely on classical computing architecture to handle many tasks, which creates speed bottlenecks.
And while today’s most powerful quantum computers have around 1,000 qubits, some predict that a scale of hundreds of thousands or even millions could be needed for advanced problems.
Adding new qubits isn’t as easy as it sounds. In fact, it’s a hugely complex engineering problem, as qubits have to be isolated from the outside world so they don't decohere, and they have to be frozen to temperatures millionths of a degree above absolute zero.
In simple terms, today’s technologies are largely experimental, proof-of-concept or prototypes. Although they are constantly improving, they aren’t the scalable, robust systems needed for industrial applications.
## **Towards Quantum Supremacy**
While big challenges remain, some hugely significant strides have been taken in recent years.
Google that it had developed revolutionary methods of improving the error tolerance of quantum computing by combining multiple qubits to make logical qubits.
New types of qubits, like photonic qubits and trapped ion qubits, are also showing promise when it comes to improving stability.
And breakthroughs have been made in the development of , which could remove the expense of super-cooling from the equations.
Progress is also ongoing in building the infrastructure that needs to be in place for quantum to be truly useful once the power is available.
This involves creating quantum programming languages like Microsoft Q#, IBM Qiskit, or the open-source , as well as operating systems.
And Microsoft recently announced a breakthrough with , the world’s first topological qubit processor. This processor uses an entirely new state of matter to dramatically improve qubit stability and scale—potentially enabling the integration of over a million qubits on a single chip, a major leap toward practical quantum computing.
Challenges certainly also remain around building out a human workforce that will be able to fully leverage it. This will require a big investment in education, skills, and training.
So we’re heading in the right direction along the path to – the point where quantum computers can solve problems that classical computers simply can’t.
Although “true” quantum might not be immediately around the corner, I don’t think it will be long before we can at least start to see it making a difference in our lives.

Over the last week, the **Trump administration may have emboldened Russian aggression** both on the ground in Ukraine and in cyberspace. Trump in the aftermath of cancelling numerous USAID contracts wasn’t the only move that stunned world leaders: last week it was that defense secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a pause on cyberattacks against Russian targets.
While this **doesn’t affect intelligence work carried out by the National Security Agency** , and there’s a lack of clarity on precisely what DOD hackers have been ordered to do or not do, the **Hegseth move signalled that the U.S. is backing off aggression against Russia** , while amping up its rhetoric against Ukraine and President Zelensky. Ostensibly, it’s being done to encourage a peace deal, albeit through classic Trumpian brinksmanship rather than old school diplomacy.
A review of contracts cancelled by **Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)** shows a significant amount of U.S.-backed work in Ukraine has already come to an end. That includes a $90 million project to try to reduce corruption in Ukraine, a **$256 million program to support a “unified, democratic, and European-oriented recovery for Ukraine from Russian invasion,”** and an $8.5 million project to get vital security information to better protect USAID partners on the ground.
Though there’s plenty of anxiety about what Hegseth ordered, there may be some nuance to it. Two defense department contractors told _Forbes_ that they believe the order may only affect military operations under . “How many of those attacks are conducted by the military vs. the intelligence community?” said one source. “**My gut tells me little will change**.”
There may also be some misunderstanding as to the scope of the wider strategy when it comes to dealing with Russian cyberespionage. One report claimed that the DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) had also been told that it shouldn’t focus as much on Russia, though CISA refuted the claim in a public statement, saying, “CISA’s mission is to defend against all cyber threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure, including from Russia. There has been **no change in our posture**. Any reporting to the contrary is fake and undermines our national security.” Sources at **CISA also told _Forbes_ they’d not heard anything about any new guidance on Russia**.
If there are any new strategies in dealing with Russian cyberattacks at CISA, it won’t have come from Hegseth, who has **no authority over CISA** , a CISA staffer told _Forbes_.
Regardless, the **optics indicate a more pro-Russia strategy** under the current administration than has been seen from any White House in recent memory.

## THE BIG STORY:
## Staggering Number Of Teens Personally Know Someone Targeted By Deepfake Nudes
![teens targeted by AI deepfake nudes](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67c72737ab50166d3e923f34/teens-targeted-by-AI-deepfake-nudes/1960x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=144)

As AI technology has grown more sophisticated and simpler to use, so too has the prevalence and ease with which teens obtain them. It is trivially easy to create and share such content – which **disproportionately affects teen girls and women**.
In new research from child protection nonprofit Thorn it’s **clear the spread of AI-generated explicit images is being witnessed by America’s youth**. The survey showed that one in eight Americans under the age of 18 personally know someone who’s had an AI-generated pornographic deepfake made of them, while one in 17 teens has been directly victimized by an AI deepfake.
## Stories You Have To Read Today
Israeli phone forensics giant **Cellebrite** has **suspended sales in Serbia** , after revelations that the company’s products were used to break into a device belonging to a youth activist in the country, Amnesty International .
**Microsoft** filed a lawsuit in which it **named four individuals who’ve been misusing its generative AI tools**. The tech giant the four were part of a hacking group dubbed Storm-2139, which used passwords leaked online to gain access to its AI tools, altered their capabilities and resold access to other malicious actors. They also provided “**detailed instructions on how to generate harmful and illicit content,** including non-consensual intimate images of celebrities and other sexually explicit content,” Microsoft wrote in a blog post.
## Winner of the Week
**Jen Easterly** , former CISA director, is trying to help her old colleagues who’ve been fired from the agency under the Trump administration. She’s a matching site via a Google form to **connect employers to cyber experts now looking for work**.
## Loser of the Week
Russian national **Aleksei Andriunin** was extradited from Portugal to the U.S. this week, **charged with manipulating cryptocurrency markets on behalf of industry clients**. As founder and CEO of Gotbit, it’s alleged he developed code to “wash trade” cryptocurrencies to artificially inflate trading volume, giving a boost to a given currency and get it on major exchanges. He made millions in the process, according to the .

The world of enterprise AI is undergoing a quiet revolution. While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have grabbed headlines, a new breed of AI is emerging from the shadows: small language models (SLMs). These compact powerhouses prove that bigger isn't always better, offering a compelling blend of efficiency, affordability and accuracy tailor-made for the business world.
## Why Small Language Models?
Sam Altman says the , and future strides in AI will require new ideas.
PROMOTED
As described by FBC member Abhi Maheshwari in his , "SLMs are smaller versions of LLM counterparts and have significantly fewer parameters, typically ranging from a few million to a few billion."
SLMs are gaining popularity because they focus on specific tasks, unlike LLMs, which are trained on vast amounts of data to tackle a broad range of tasks. On the other hand, SLMs are purpose-built for specific applications. This targeted approach yields several advantages:
Training an LLM like GPT-4 can cost millions of dollars and take months. SLMs, in contrast, require significantly fewer resources, slashing training costs. Maheshwari notes that"SLMs cost just 1/10th of what LLMs require,offering a highly cost-effective solution for many enterprise applications."
This makes AI accessible to businesses of all sizes, democratizing the power of this transformative technology.
LLMs often struggle with accuracy. They can exhibit bias and "hallucinations," generating plausible but factually incorrect or nonsensical information. SLMs can minimize the risk of these issues by training on carefully curated, domain-specific datasets. This is crucial for businesses where accuracy is paramount, from customer service to financial analysis. Additionally, to adapt to evolving business needs, SLMs can be quickly fine-tuned and updated. SLMs can perform well in dynamic environments where rapid response is key.
Using a closed-source LLM through an API may risk exposing sensitive information. In contrast, many open-source , offering greater control and security tailored to an organization’s needs.
## Challenges Of Small Language Models
Trained on smaller datasets, SLMs have a narrower scope of knowledge than their larger counterparts. They may struggle with tasks requiring extensive general knowledge or deep contextual understanding. Besides this, SLMs are less adept at handling complex reasoning and problem-solving tasks that demand multistep planning and analysis.
The smaller size of SLMs limits their ability to store lots of factual knowledge. This can lead to incorrect responses, more biases and irrelevant content. However, these issues can be addressed through several methods. These include using selected training data and targeted improvements after training.
SLMs aren't meant to take the place of LLMs. Instead, they work alongside LLMs, creating a varied AI toolkit that meets a range of business needs. These small models can be combined to tackle even bigger challenges.
## Companies Embracing Small Language Models
Forward-thinking companies are already reaping the benefits of SLMs. Most of the companies are trying to experiment SLM in pilot phase as this technology carries substantial potential.
Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft,. Microsoft is adopting a hybrid approach by using SLMs internally to handle specific tasks while routing more complex queries to LLMs.
A report from _The Times of India_ detailed how NoBroker, a real estate platform, These models comprehend multiple Indian languages, providing features like conversation summarization and sentiment analysis. Akhil Gupta, co-founder of NoBroker, emphasized with appropriate training data, SLMs can be highly effective for specific use cases. He stated, "You can build a model for a particular use case... with just 10 hours of recording."
## Future Prospects: A Bright Horizon For Tiny Titans
Key trends shaping the future of SLMs include:
**• On-Device AI:** SLMs allow AI to function directly on devices (such as smartphones), facilitating offline capabilities and enhancing privacy boundaries.
**• Multimodal Functionality:** Recently, multimodal SLMs have begun to understand and generate not just text but also images, sounds, and various other modalities. This advancement enables applications in visual search, product recognition and audio analysis.
**• Personalized AI:** Because SLM applications rely on user-specific data, they create opportunities for hyper-personalized AI experiences.
## Conclusion
As enterprises investigate the possibilities presented by AI, SLMs are positioned to empower organizations to leverage the capabilities of this transformative technology in a manner that is efficient, affordable and specifically tailored to their distinct needs.
Although the potential is vast, navigating this new terrain can be complex because organizations must adapt to rapid technological advancements.

AI search powered by LLMs is changing how consumers look for products and services.
NurPhoto via Getty Images
Artificial intelligence is (AI) is beginning to change the ways consumers find and trust information. A striking finding from the reveals that nearly 41% of consumers trust Gen AI search results more than paid search results, while only 15% trust AI less than search ads.
The study is based on two multi-market surveys of 5,000 consumers aged 18-67 residing in the US, UK, Canada and Australia.
This shift in consumer trust represents a major change for digital marketers who rely on paid search as a major part of their customer acquisition and sales strategy.
## **How Is AI Search Different?**
Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot offer new ways for consumers to research products and services. Unlike traditional search engines that return a list of links, these AI tools provide conversational, natural language responses synthesized from multiple sources.
PROMOTED
According to the report, 43% of consumers would trust information given by an AI chatbot or tool, up from 40% just last year. Among those who already use Gen AI tools, that figure jumps to an impressive 68%, with 14% saying they trust AI-provided information "completely."
For marketers, this trend creates both opportunities and challenges. Being mentioned organically by an AI tool appears to create a halo effect for brands—a kind of digital earned media that carries more credibility than paid placement.
MORE FOR YOU
## **AI Search Has a Demographic Divide**
Not all consumers view AI with equal enthusiasm. The report highlights significant differences across demographics:
  * Men are more likely to trust AI search results (44%) compared to women (37%)
  * Younger consumers aged 18-30 show higher trust in AI search (44%) than those 50+ (37%)
  * American and British consumers demonstrate greater faith in AI search (43%) compared to Australians and Canadians (36%)


These disparities suggest that brands targeting younger, male-dominated markets may need to adapt their digital strategies more quickly than those focused on older audiences.
## **New Patterns of Search Behavior**
While traditional search engines aren't going away, consumer behavior is evolving rapidly. The report found that 27% of consumers now use Gen AI for at least half of their internet searches. Among Gen Z and younger millennials, the adoption rate is even more striking—37% of Brits under 40 use AI for at least half of their searches.
With traditional search, brands could rely on search engine optimization and pay-per-click advertising to ensure visibility. In the AI search paradigm, being mentioned by the algorithm offers legitimacy that paid placement can’t match.
## **The Disruptive Power of AI Search**
Right now, Gen AI search tools don’t offer pay-to-play opportunities, meaning brands cannot buy ads or pay to be mentioned. The democratization of search results based purely on relevance and helpfulness means brands need to focus on becoming genuinely useful sources of information. Or, they at least need to create content that AI models find relevant and helpful.
The rise of AI search could lead to the most significant disruption to digital marketing since the introduction of Google Ads.
For years, Google in particular has remained unchallenged as the dominant search engine, despite Microsoft and others spending billions to try to gain market share. This dominance is now under attack.
## **How Should Marketers Respond to AI Search?**
Brands that optimize their content for LLMs now will likely enjoy a significant advantage as this technology becomes mainstream.
  1. **Optimize for AI, not just SEO** : While traditional SEO remains important, developing clear, factual, and comprehensive content that answers specific questions will help ensure your brand gets mentioned in AI responses.
  2. **Focus on trustworthiness and authority** : The report shows consumers trust AI partly because they perceive it as less biased than human-curated information. Ensure your brand's digital footprint emphasizes objective expertise.
  3. **Segment strategies by demographic** : Given the trust differences between age groups and genders, tailor your approach to match your target audience's comfort level with AI.
  4. **Embrace the change** : The 60% of existing AI users who expect to increase their usage in the next six months signals a trend that will only accelerate. It’s time for the CMO and the (if there is one) to put their heads together.


## **What’s Next for AI Search?**
As AI search tools continue to evolve, we may see new opportunities for brands to engage with these platforms ethically. For now, the best approach is to produce genuinely valuable content that serves as the raw material for AI-generated responses.
It’s also possible that the AI search tools will find ways to incorporate ads in a way that doesn’t reduce trust in their results. Currently, revenue and profit for the big AI companies with their stratospheric valuations. Monetizing search via advertising could be one way to add a significant revenue stream.
With or without paid ads, the growth in AI search presents the most significant opportunity in a decade for challenger brands to gain ground against established players—if they can successfully navigate the new AI-driven search landscape.

Over the past six weeks, a recurring question has surfaced in my leadership development sessions with executives. It takes different forms, but the core inquiry remains the same:
> _“How do we reconcile the human-centered leadership you advocate with the leadership we see playing out on the global political stage?”_
![President Trump Hosts Ukrainian President Zelensky At The White House](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67c9787f6a58b08a3856e5b9/President-Trump-Hosts-Ukrainian-President-Zelensky-At-The-White-House/960x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=144)
The Oval Office Showdown 
Getty Images
I am neither a political commentator nor a global affairs analyst. My focus is leadership—what works, in which contexts, and why. That’s what I’ll explore here.
For years, I’ve championed Future Fit Leadership, which is fundamentally human-centric (an approach I explore more deeply in my book _)_. This model is built on curiosity, purpose, openness, respect, and empathy—qualities that foster trust, drive collaboration, and encourage innovation. It’s about flattening the hierarchy to unleash the best thinking in the room and make smarter, faster decisions.
PROMOTED
At the opposite end of the spectrum, we see a starkly different leadership model emerging. It’s embodied by President Trump and Vice President Vance in last week’s infamous Oval Office showdown with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. That interaction relied on a win-lose mentality, rigid hierarchy, and domination. The underlying message?
_"If I have more power, money, or strength than you, I will treat you as an instrument of my will. And you will comply."_
MORE FOR YOU
## Why Does This Matter to Business Leaders?
The question arises because humans copy humans. We naturally look to mimic successful behavior. On the surface, Trump’s approach appears to be working. His power-driven, winner-takes-all leadership style is reshaping geopolitics and steamrolling his opponents. So, does this mean his approach is worth emulating in corporate life?
Absolutely not. Here’s why.
## 1. Leadership Is Always Context-Specific
A leadership style that thrives in one setting can fail spectacularly in another. Geopolitics has always been a ruthless game of power, often devoid of moral or ethical considerations. Even in a political administration with more polished rhetoric, international negotiations frequently play out as high-stakes, winner-takes-all battles.
However, this brand of muscular, aggressive leadership has a short shelf life in the corporate world—especially in complex, global organizations.
Consider Microsoft. Under Steve Ballmer (2000-2014), the company was run with a combative, competitive mindset. Ballmer dismissed emerging trends like cloud computing, and Microsoft became known for internal rivalries and resistance to change. Nadella (2014–present) by contrast, embraced a human-centered, purpose-driven leadership approach. He promotes curiosity, empathy, and collaboration, shifting Microsoft’s culture from competition to collaboration. His mantra?
_"We are moving from a group of people who know it all to a group of people who want to learn it all."_
This leadership mindset contributed to the business becoming a leader in cloud computing, AI, and enterprise solutions. During Nadella’s tenure, Microsoft’s market cap increased from around $300 billion in 2014 to exceeding $3 trillion today, a roughly 10-fold increase. This huge growth is as much about a psychological evolution as technological innovation. The takeaway for corporate leaders: domination-based leadership may work in politics, but businesses thrive on agility, trust, and shared purpose.
## 2. Organizational Leadership Requires a Different Outcome
Great leaders ask:
_What is the response do I want from the people who experience my leadership?_
Trump and Vance demand absolute loyalty and subservience – as seen in their interactions with Zelensky. Because they hold all the cards, they will likely get it—or at least a facade of compliance.
But business leaders at all levels need something fundamentally different:
  * Commitment, not just compliance
  * Alignment, not forced submission
  * A workforce that is intrinsically motivated—not just responding to rewards and punishments


Human engagement is not solely motivated by juicy carrots and big scary sticks. It stems from people _wanting_ to pursue the vision and goals of the leader and the organization they represent. Fear may drive short-term obedience, but it kills long-term engagement.
## 3. Businesses Need Agile Decision-Making
The organizations I work with aren’t just dealing with political and economic uncertainty—they’re grappling with AI, digitalization, and other megatrends accelerating the pace of change. To survive, companies must be:
  * Agile
  * Fast-moving
  * Decentralized in decision-making


This means pushing power away from the center and toward the front lines—empowering middle managers and frontline employees to think creatively and act decisively. That’s simply not possible under a fear-based, compliance-driven leadership model.
## 4. Innovation Requires Psychological Safety
If you want people to develop new ideas and ways of working, take risks, and think independently, they cannot operate in an environment of quaking subservience. Fear-based leadership might command short-term conformity, but it crushes initiative.
Smart leaders today understand that power is not something to be hoarded at the top—it’s something to be distributed strategically. Influence comes not from dominance, but from enabling others to succeed.
## The Trump Playbook: A Dead-End Strategy for Business
President Trump’s leadership style may be effective in the political arena—for now. Part of the global anxiety and unease is uncertainty about what comes next. However, for business leaders, copying the Trump-Vance model is a path to irrelevance. The future belongs to those who:
  * Foster trust
  * Empower their teams
  * Build cultures of curiosity, resilience, and adaptability


The world is changing at an exponential rate. The new U.S. administration is accelerating this paradigm shift in some areas. Leaders must evolve and adapt—but they also must be careful about the lessons they take from the chaos unfolding around them.
Not all power leads to progress.

The global race is on to build enough edge data centers to keep up with sky-high demand. The worldwide edge data center market is projected to reach , a 107% surge since its $153 billion valuation in 2020, but this number doesn’t tell the whole story.
and are revolutionizing entire industries—from manufacturing and transportation to healthcare and retail—and these developments will likely result in trillions of dollars of true economic impact. U.S. business leaders can’t sit back and wait for the next chapter to unfold. Profound changes, driven by an increased need for computing power, advanced hardware, strategic investments and partnerships, are redrawing the global tech map and making it clear that we need to act now to remain competitive.
PROMOTED
## Four Key Factors Propelling The Edge Revolution
### 1. Demand For Infrastructure And Hardware Is Increasing
AI’s exponential growth is only amplifying our need for robust edge infrastructure to support it. Even as AI models become more efficient, there is still unrelenting demand for AI that is better and faster. If a new model promises to perform 10 times more efficiently than the leading model, it won't be long until we want it to run 100 times faster. We're missing the forest for the trees if we think efficiency gains will slow our need for greater computing power.
The new era of AI also requires substantial hardware resources. In 2024, estimated that total AI chip sales that year would account for 11% of the $576 billion global market: "Growing from roughly $US50 billion today, the AI chip market is forecasted to reach up to US$400 billion by 2027, though a more conservative estimate is US$110 billion."
Nvidia is leading the AI chip market, but the industry is in an ongoing arms race for accelerated hardware performance. Nvidia originally designed its chips to , not power AI models, and startups are now creating chips specifically optimized for AI workloads.
### 2. Nuclear Power Is Making A Comeback
The power demands of AI are enormous and continue to rise. Due to increasing generative AI usage, "electricity consumption by data centers is forecasted to double to 4% of global electricity consumption by 2030," according to .
The tech industry, including giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, is rethinking its approach to meet these growing energy requirements by investing in . Three Mile Island, a nuclear power plant that closed in 2019, is reopening after Microsoft signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation. Nuclear energy must play a critical—and urgent—role in supporting future AI and edge developments. Based on , “85-90 gigawatts (GW) of new nuclear capacity would be needed to meet all of the data center power demand growth expected by 2030 (relative to 2023). But well less than 10% will be available globally by 2030.”
### 3. China Is Setting The Pace For Growth
China is executing an ambitious to be the world leader in AI by 2030. AI has the potential to add $600 billion annually to China’s economy. The Chinese government has invested heavily in a multipronged approach to AI and edge infrastructure innovation. China’s focus on AI ecosystem innovation, research and development and supply chain ownership extends all the way to the technology’s basic components, including necessary for building semiconductors.
The U.S. tech sector is watching China with justifiable concern: The country’s immense domestic AI footprint is having a global impact. In January, Chinese AI startup DeepSeek released an AI model similar to ChatGPT called R1 and . Nvidia's stock price dropped 17% in a day before starting to recover the following day.
### 4. The U.S. Is Balancing Domestic Investment And Global Collaboration
For tech companies in the U.S. and other countries in Europe and emerging markets, this is a pivotal moment. As business leaders, we have the opportunity to respond to China’s growth with both competitive investments and open-market collaboration.
Mutually beneficial global partnerships with allies, such as EU countries and , will allow us to align our interests, share knowledge, innovate and drive business outcomes. We need to stay competitive by building more self-sufficient, resilient supply chains and finding the right balance of technological innovation and regulation. This shift will require substantial collective investments in next-generation hardware, software, training and infrastructure. AI is reshaping every sector, and we are only beginning to realize its true economic value. The decisions we make now will enable our collective ability to flourish on a global scale.

Software-as-a-service (SaaS), a solution influenced by the rise in artificial intelligence (AI) services, is expected to transform sectors. AI SaaS providers claim to make things easy, seamless and intelligent as a service. AI-driven services have developed fast; however, they have not yet delivered the innovation they promised. AI-driven services advanced quickly but ultimately fell short.
Why? The simple answer lies in the fundamental limitations of AI SaaS, changes in AI services and market demands, which favor customized products far more than standard ones.
## Challenge In AI SaaS
While it is the other way around from the traditional SaaS, a platform for presenting AI applications itself has some built-in limitations towards innovation in the following manner:
PROMOTED
### Generic Models And The “One Size Fits All” Approach
Often, generalized usage of AI SaaS is dependent on a pre-trained model. However, true value is in the context of specific learning when models learn through unique datasets. This is where AI services, particularly in the cases of custom AI consulting and implementation firms, shine in creating a solution that is molded to suit any industry or business need or specific data environment.
### Problems Of Data Privacy & Ownership
AI SaaS solutions run on a shared system through the cloud, and that causes a problem related to data security. Furthermore, due to the problem of security exposure and compliance issues such as GDPR and HIPAA, most enterprises tend not to share sensitive data with SaaS organizations. On the other hand, on-premises or private clouds have AI service vendors who allow control over data while serviced by AI in the organization.
### Lack Of Customizability & Agility
AI SaaS is built to work with standard inputs and pre-defined workflows. Yet, real-world AI applications need dynamic compliance. The AI service providers continuously retrain algorithms to keep them relevant, capabilities that off-the-shelf AI SaaS products often lack, and it can fine-tune models and integrate with the unique data pipelines.
### The Black Box Problem
Most AI SaaS products keep their decision making opaque. For businesses in highly regulated markets, like finance and health care, explainability and auditability are required, as well as the control of AI-driven results. Generalized AI SaaS is tricky to create for intuitions around deep insights, model interpretability and the governance framework.
## AI Services And The “Invention Contest”
AI-driven services, including AI consulting firms, managed AI solutions and custom AI development, are growing faster than the AI SaaS innovation. This seems to be happening due to the following three reasons:
### Domain-Specific Expertise
AI service providers specialize in industry-specific AI solutions, leveraging deep expertise in fields like healthcare, finance, supply chain management and cybersecurity. This allows them to design AI models that truly address business pain points rather than offering generic AI capabilities.
### Continuous Model Improvement
AI technology is not a “set it and forget it” thing. For effective AI executions, it needs ongoing monitoring, fine-tuning and reskilling. The service providers provide continuous model optimization for AI solutions that evolve with data trends as well as with shifting business requirements.
### Integration Into Enterprise Ecosystem
Unlike the AI SaaS platforms, which can be used as a standalone tool, AI services focus on being deeply integrated with the enterprise tech stack, which also includes cloud environments, legacy systems and third-party applications. This makes the AI embedded in business operations, thus leading to more effective outcomes.
## How To Overcome The Challenges Of AI SaaS
### Shifting From Pre-Built AI Models To Adaptive AI
• Instead of building AI SaaS, which is just dependent on pre-trained static AI models, AI SaaS should have mechanisms of continuous learning that evolve with real-world data.
• AI SaaS should allow users to drive the customization. In this, organizations can fine-tune models as per their requirements and needs.
### Adopt The Models Of Hybrid Deployment
• Many organizations feel that they are required to share sensitive business data with a cloud-based AI SaaS platform.
• What’s the solution? The hybrid AI models allow businesses to process AI workloads both on premises and on the cloud, certifying the data sovereignty and compliance.
### Prioritize AI Governance And Compliance
• The AI SaaS vendors must adhere to GDPR, HIPAA and ISO standards so that there are in-built regulatory frameworks adapted to the needs of different industries.
• Auditable as well as transparent AI models would minimize the risks associated with the regulated enterprise sectors.
### Build The AI SaaS With Continuous Learning & Human-AI Collaboration In Mind
• Traditional AI SaaS frequently lacks real-time learning, which leads to outdated models that fail to adapt to market changes.
• The future of AI SaaS is in the “human-in-loop” AI. People have AI aiding their work and are always learning from the new feedback made by users.
## Conclusion
For example, AI SaaS does not stand out to solve major challenges because it chooses to stay set in standardization rather than customization and automation over human intelligence. In contrast, AI services firms are very profitable companies that provide customized, domain-specific and continuously improving AI solutions to various businesses.
AI doesn’t need to be a one-size-fits-all SaaS solution. It can evolve with the businesses. For AI SaaS companies to do well, they must bridge the gap between automation and customization.
Firms must shift from customized standardized AI automation to adaptive explainable industry-specific AI solutions to stay ahead of the market within AI SaaS—or lose out to AI service providers that focus on tailor-made orders and intelligence maturity.

While personal rethinking habits are crucial, the real leadership challenge is embedding . Teams that embrace rethinking are more innovative, adaptive, and resilient. Yet, too many organizations discourage employees from challenging ideas, favoring stability over progress. Great leaders don’t just rethink their own perspectives—they encourage their teams to do the same. Here’s how leaders can create an environment where questioning assumptions, challenging conventional wisdom, and adapting to change become core practices.
## Make Intellectual Humility a Strength, Not a Weakness
Employees are more likely to rethink when they see their leaders do it first. —acknowledging when they’ve changed their minds or made incorrect assumptions—set the tone for a culture where learning is prioritized over ego. For example, when Satya Nadella took over as Microsoft CEO, he publicly admitted that the company had been too insular and needed to adopt a more open, collaborative mindset. His willingness to rethink old strategies encouraged employees at every level to do the same.
## Encourage Constructive Dissent
The best ideas don’t come from echo chambers—they emerge from environments where people feel safe challenging each other’s thinking. on psychological safety shows that teams where dissent is encouraged perform better and innovate faster. To foster a culture of constructive dissent, leaders should actively seek out opposing viewpoints. A simple yet powerful question is, “What’s the strongest argument against this idea?” By normalizing debate and discussion, leaders prevent groupthink and improve decision quality.

## Turn Learning from Mistakes Into a Shared Practice
, but in many organizations, they’re treated as failures rather than learning opportunities. Leaders can shift this mindset by implementing decision pre-mortems—asking teams to identify potential flaws in a strategy before executing it. Organizations like Pixar and P&G use structured feedback loops to ensure continuous learning. By making course corrections a normal part of the workflow, they reinforce the idea that rethinking isn’t a reaction to failure but an essential component of success.
## Rethinking as an Organizational Superpower
The best organizations don’t cling to past successes; they constantly evolve. Leaders who build teams that embrace rethinking create workplaces that are more innovative, adaptive, and resilient. By encouraging intellectual humility, fostering psychological safety, and normalizing feedback and learning from mistakes, leaders ensure that their teams don’t just keep up with change—they drive it.

As in the United States continues to hang in the balance, President Donald Trump has revealed that the U.S. government is actively engaging with potential buyers about the platform's future.
Speaking aboard Air Force One on Sunday, as reported by , Trump stated that his administration was in touch with four groups regarding the sale of the Chinese-owned social media platform, with all options being regarded in a positive light. “A lot of people want it,” Trump told reporters, hinting at multiple potential paths forward, and "all four are good."
Among the potential players, Frank McCourt — the former Los Angeles Dodgers owner — has emerged as one of the interested parties. Other prospective buyers in the past have also included the likes of Oracle and Microsoft, though the specific details of their current interest remain unclear.
PROMOTED
## TikTok’s Uncertain Future
The standoff stems from legislation passed in 2024 that mandated that , TikTok’s China-based parent company, must either sell the platform or face a nationwide ban. An initial deadline of Jan. 19, 2025, was subsequently extended by Trump's executive order by 75 days, pushing the critical date to April 5.
TikTok’s potential sale represents a complex technological and geopolitical challenge. Congress originally passed the legislation citing national security concerns about potential Chinese government surveillance — a claim ByteDance has consistently denied.
MORE FOR YOU
As for Trump, his approach marks a significant shift from his previous administration's stance. Where he once sought to ban TikTok entirely, he now appears committed to finding a resolution that balances national security interests with the platform's substantial U.S. user base.
The president has also indicated that he will , leaving room for continued negotiations. However, legal constraints limit his ability to extend beyond 90 days and any extension requires evidence that TikTok owner ByteDance is genuinely working toward a sale.
ByteDance, meanwhile, maintains that it would prefer to shut down the app in the U.S. rather than sell — adding another layer of complexity to the ongoing negotiations. The company has been in active discussions with the Trump administration, exploring potential alternatives to a full divestiture.
The resolution of TikTok’s position in the U.S. will likely serve as a watershed moment in how democratic nations manage technological assets with potential national security implications. It’s a complex narrative of technology, geopolitics and the delicate balance between innovation and security, with currently no firm resolution in sight.

In addition to its , the movie "Conclave" stands out as a masterclass in the intricate dynamics of succession planning and stakeholder management—two critical elements that can upend merger or acquisition (M&A) deals. The mesmerizing movie provides a rare peek inside the Vatican’s traditionally secretive process for selecting a new Pope, revealing coalition-building, strategic negotiations, and competing interests that parallel leadership challenges I've witnessed in M&A deal-making transactions.
For executives navigating the complex world of M&A, the similarities are striking and instructive. Watching "Conclave", I drew five lessons that reflect the ideal approach for M&A deal leadership selection and stakeholder engagement (warning: spoiler alert):
  1. Identify different stakeholder agendas
  2. Beware the shifting power dynamics
  3. Seek leaders who bridge divides
  4. Work backward from the desired goal
  5. Honor tradition while embracing change


## **Identify Different Stakeholder Agendas**
With "Conclave," we witness an assembly of cardinals, each representing different theological perspectives, regional interests, and personal ambitions. This layout bears remarkable resemblance to the complex web of stakeholder interests in major M&A transactions.
PROMOTED
Just as the film portrays factions forming among traditionalists, progressives, and geographic blocs, M&A deals involve multiple stakeholder groups with divergent priorities:
  * Executives concerned with governance and leadership roles
  * Shareholders focused primarily on transaction value
  * Regulators scrutinizing competitive implications
  * Employees anxious about cultural fit and job security
  * Customers wondering how service quality might change


The film's protagonist, Cardinal Lawrence (played by Ralph Fiennes), must navigate these competing interests while maintaining the integrity of the process—much like M&A leaders who must balance shareholder value with organizational health and stakeholder concerns.
In my experience advising companies through major transitions, those who succeed in complex deals share Cardinal Lawrence’s ability to recognize and address the legitimate interests of all stakeholders rather than focusing exclusively on financial considerations. They understand that successful integration requires acknowledging that each stakeholder group evaluates success through a different lens.

When , CEO Satya Nadella demonstrated this stakeholder-centric approach by preserving LinkedIn's distinct culture and leadership while carefully explaining the strategic benefits to shareholders, employees, and users—ensuring all groups saw value in the combination.
## **Beware the Shifting Power Dynamics**
Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of "Conclave" is its portrayal of the subtle and not-so-subtle power plays among the cardinals. We see coalition-building, strategic voting, and careful positioning for influence—all dynamics that play out in boardrooms during major corporate transactions.
Three critical power dynamics emerge from the film which offer insight for M&A leaders:
### **The Influence of Informal Power**
In "Conclave," formal ecclesiastical rank doesn't always determine influence. Similarly, in M&A scenarios, informal influence networks often prove more important than organizational charts. Smart acquirers map not just the formal hierarchy but also identify the cultural carriers and informal leaders whose support is essential for successful integration.
### **The Danger of Hidden Agendas**
The film's plot twists hinge on undisclosed motivations and hidden information. This mirrors a common M&A pitfall: stakeholders with undeclared objectives can derail integration if their interests aren't surfaced and addressed. Effective due diligence extends beyond financial and operational factors to uncover the personal and political dynamics that might impact implementation.
### **The Balance of Tradition and Progress**
Throughout "Conclave," tension exists between preserving tradition and embracing change—a dilemma familiar to any leader managing a significant organizational transition. The most successful acquirers respect the heritage of both companies while creating a compelling vision for their combined future.
These power dynamics require careful navigation, just as Cardinal Lawrence must skillfully maneuver through Vatican politics while keeping sight of the ultimate goal.
## **Seek Leaders Who Bridge Divides While Charting New Territory**
At its core, "Conclave" is about succession—selecting a leader who can guide an institution through uncertain times. This parallels one of the most consequential decisions in any merger or acquisition: determining the leadership team for the combined entity.
The film’s central question—who is best equipped to lead?—requires evaluating candidates not just on past performance but on their ability to unite disparate factions and navigate unprecedented challenges. This mirrors the challenge of M&A leadership selection, where technical or financial competence must be balanced with cultural fit and change management capability.
In my work with companies navigating post-deal transitions, I’ve observed that executives who successfully drove a company’s growth phase are not necessarily the best guides through integration. Different skill sets are required when steering people through uncertainty. Similar to how the cardinals in "Conclave" reassess the essential qualities for the next Pope, selecting effective integration leaders requires valuing unification skills over performance metrics alone.
When Disney acquired Pixar, they recognized that was essential to the deal’s success. Rather than imposing Disney’s leadership approach, they elevated Pixar's Ed Catmull and John Lasseter to leadership positions over Disney's animation division—demonstrating how selecting bridge-builders can transform an acquisition into a creative renaissance.
## **Work Backward from The Desired Goal**
As I watched "Conclave," I was struck by how Cardinal Lawrence exemplifies the principle of working backward from the desired outcome—in his case, selecting a Pope who can effectively lead the Church through modern challenges. This approach mirrors successful M&A integration, where leaders begin with a clear vision of the combined entity's future state and work backward to design the integration process.
Too often, itself rather than the transformation required to realize its potential. By working backward from a detailed vision of success—as Cardinal Lawrence does in evaluating papal candidates—leaders can design integration processes that address not just operational consolidation but the human and cultural elements essential for long-term value creation.
![Prime Member Deal](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67c69295f65ad5e0167b5e7c/Prime-Member-Deal/960x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=144)

The Amazon-Whole Foods merger demonstrates this principle in action. Amazon of how the combined entity would transform grocery shopping, then worked backward to implement the necessary changes—integrating Amazon Prime into Whole Foods' operations while maintaining the quality standards that made Whole Foods valuable in the first place.
## **Honor Tradition While Embracing Change**
"Conclave" concludes with a surprising but ultimately fitting selection—a choice that honors tradition while embracing necessary change. The best M&A integrations achieve a similar balance, respecting the heritage of both organizations while creating something stronger than either could become independently.
When Marriott acquired Starwood Hotels, they carefully and loyalty programs that customers valued while gradually integrating back-end operations. This thoughtful approach maintained brand equity while capturing the operational efficiencies that justified the deal.
Similarly, successful M&A leaders recognize that honoring each organization's traditions creates the trust necessary for embracing transformative change. By acknowledging "the way things were done" before building the bridge to "the way things will be done," these leaders create the necessary for innovation and adaptation.
## **The Ultimate Power Play**
Perhaps the most valuable insights from “Conclave” for C-Suite leaders navigating M&A power plays is that successful organizational transitions—whether in ancient religious institutions or modern corporations—require both analytical rigor and emotional intelligence.
The technical aspects of merger integration matter enormously, but equally important is the ability to navigate complex human dynamics with wisdom and foresight. The most successful M&A leaders, like Cardinal Lawrence, recognize that the ultimate power play isn’t about domination but orchestration— guiding the organization toward a shared future that honors the past while embracing necessary change.
For C-Suite leaders embarking on M&A journeys, "Conclave" offers this final lesson: in the high-stakes drama of corporate combinations, those who master both the mechanics of integration and the art of human connection will create the most enduring value.

Here are five things in tech that happened this week and how they affect your business.
Did you miss them?
## This Week in Business Tech News
## Business Tech News #1 – Gmail is killing SMS 2 Factor Authentication login codes in favor of this instead.
As first reported by , Gmail is phasing out SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) codes due to security concerns. Google will instead introduce QR codes for authentication – which are more secure than SMS codes. This change aims to reduce the risk of phishing and SIM-swapping attacks. According to Google, the transition will take place over the next few months, and users will need to scan a QR code with their phone to complete the authentication process. (Source: )
## Why this is important for your business:
Once upon a time people frowned on the used of QR codes. But COVID proved them wrong, and now QR codes are being used everywhere. Most consumers are familiar with the process and it’s interesting that Google considers them more secure than SMS 2FA. Will this be the new substitutes for SMS 2FA? My advice: download an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator) and use that too, or instead of your current 2FA process. Or use a USB key.

## Business Tech News #2 – OpenAI's Deep Research can save you hours of work – and now it's a lot cheaper to access.
Sabrina Ortiz of ZDNet reported on the expansion of Deep Research – OpenAI’s tool that allows users to perform in-depth, multi-step research using data from the public web, generating detailed reports with citations from multiple online sources. Initially restricted to Pro users, Deep Research is now available to all paying ChatGPT users – Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu subscribers. The tool is designed for people who do intensive knowledge work in areas like finance, science, policy, and engineering. Users can now access 10 deep research queries per month, while Pro users have 120 queries per month. (Source: )
MORE FOR YOU
## Why this is important for your business:
Does this mean goodbye Perplexity, hello ChatGPT? Quite possible. I’ve been dividing up my AI chatbot assistant support between ChatGPT for most general searches and Perplexity for deeper research that I’m doing for the articles I write. But now I may be able to ditch Perplexity altogether. We’ll see. I do know that many academics in my community – professors, researchers, etc – are all giddy about the speed and accuracy of OpenAI’s Deep Research tool, and that gives me comfort.
## Business Tech News #3 – This hidden Windows feature protects you from dangerous malware.
Windows has a lesser-known feature called “Network Protection” that helps guard against malware. Unlike SmartScreen – which is primarily integrated into Edge –
Network Protection works at the system level, monitoring network traffic across all apps and processes. It checks internet data against Microsoft's reputation database for suspicious and malicious content. (Source: )
## Why this is important for your business:
Important note: this feature is deactivated by default and requires PowerShell with administrator rights to enable. It's available only on Pro or Enterprise versions of Windows 10 or 11, with Microsoft Defender active and a Microsoft account logged in. To keep your company’s security at its highest level I strongly recommend having your IT firm activate this feature and ensure that it’s setup on all Windows devices.
## Business Tech News #4 – Snapchat's SMB bet is paying off – but can it keep up the momentum?
Snapchat's focus on small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) is proving successful. The platform has seen significant growth in ad revenue from SMBs, thanks to its user-friendly tools and AI-driven advertising solutions. Sid Malhotra – Snapchat’s VP of Small Business – shared why small businesses are an important part of Snapchat’s user base: “We are making extremely big investments in the small- to medium-business space, both in the ad solutions we offer to them and in how we provide them the right service… when they win, Snap wins too.” The challenge remains to sustain this momentum as competition from other platforms like Google and Meta intensifies. Snapchat's ability to innovate and adapt will be crucial in maintaining its appeal to SMB advertisers. (Source: )
## Why this is important for your business:
It’s all about community. Snapchat users are loyal and are on the app all the time. They tend to skew younger, but I know plenty of grandparents who have learned to use the app in order to keep up with the family (FWIW my family uses it all the time as a group chat app). This is mainly a B2C play so if your target customers are end user consumers it’s a decent option to consider – and considering that more money is being plowed into the platform that can only be a good sign for users who want to invest their marketing there.
## Business Tech News #5 – AI assistants join the factory floor.
AI is increasingly being integrated into factory operations, taking over tasks traditionally performed by humans and transforming the factory floor. This shift is driven by the need for efficiency and precision in manufacturing processes. Products such as Microsoft’s Factory Operations Agent are designed specifically for manufacturers to help track defective issues, downtime, or excess energy consumption. AI-powered systems are being used for predictive maintenance, quality control, and optimizing production lines. These advancements are not only improving productivity but also reducing costs and emissions. (Source: )
## Why this is important for your business:
On the manufacturing floors of my clients I’m seeing autonomous vehicles moving materials, driverless forklifts, drones counting inventory and sensors monitoring the health of their equipment. All of these devices are capturing data for humans to analyze and act. The next phase – which is just starting – is deploying AI agents to scrutinize this data and take actions in lieu of humans doing so. Start thinking about that and asking your hardware, equipment and software vendors if agents are part of their future product plans. Finding good people is tough. Finding good and skilled people is even tougher. Agents will help alleviate these issues.
Every week I round up five important business tech news stories and opine on why they’re important for your business - and mine.

Recently, I updated my version of Microsoft Word, the word processor I’ve been using since middle school, and discovered a little colorful icon now appears beside the familiar cursor.
This icon represents Copilot, the new AI companion that Microsoft will help users "complete tasks faster" and make "content creation, data analysis, and communication more efficient." I’m old enough to remember when a cute anthropomorphic paperclip offered a similar companion experience, albeit without the sense of import that, rightly or wrongly, accompanies many large language models (LLM) generative AI software currently in use.
## The Promise And Perils Of AI
Clippy didn’t represent the apotheosis of human innovation or an existential threat to human learning. He was just a bouncy little guy who showed up in the corner of your screen, noticed that you looked like you were writing a letter, and wondered if you’d like some help.
PROMOTED
Today, we’re constantly told in commercials and through their omnipresence in search browsers and word processors that AI technologies are here to solve all our problems, to make our lives easier. This is because AI is .
Consumers are supposed to feel thankful to have these tools at their behest. So, too, are entrepreneurs and business owners, who are told that AI products are essential for promoting efficiency and can even "" during labor shortages. Yet my emotions upon seeing Copilot inviting me to "describe what I’d like to write" and offering to "inspire me" while I labored over a work of creative writing wavered between bitter annoyance and deep anger.
This emotional reaction to Copilot wasn’t because of a general dislike of AI. There are plenty of ways that AI can be used to, in both business and personal applications. I was frustrated because the endeavor in which I was engaged—writing fiction—is by its nature a product of the particular human brain doing the writing.
No LLM chatbot has my particular lexicon, my set of cadences, my references and so on. As _New Yorker_ writer Ted Chiang , every word of a novel is a choice, and making choices requires effort; no AI company at the moment is invested in creating a product that requires tremendous effort. On the contrary, "the selling point of generative A.I. is that these programs generate vastly more than you put into them, and that is precisely what prevents them from being effective tools for artists."
## AI And The Creative Mind
That’s not to say that there are no uses that a creative writer might have for AI; a recent found that generative LLMs can help individuals be more creative by offering them new ideas, but that it produces narrower, more similar content overall.
Offering ideas is one thing; offering to write my novel for me was insulting, not least because it would remove one of the most pleasurable aspects of creative writing: The alchemy of what happens when you put pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard). Creative writing is art, and when we remove the human artist, we threaten to undermine the definition of art itself (not to mention take away jobs from real human artists, a point raised during the recent).
The individual brain is essential to creative work generally and creative writing specifically, but what about academic or nonfiction writing, where much of the furor around AI writing is located?
Many teachers will tell you that ChatGPT is the true author of many student papers these days. Most of the teachers I know are less disappointed by students taking the easy way out of writing a paper and more disappointed that students are robbing themselves of the experience that they ostensibly go to school for: Learning.
## Writing As Learning
Because, ultimately, writing . This time-worn maxim has long justified the existence of writing education programs in schools and universities, and it also happens to be true according to numerous studies through the decades. Through writing, we learn critical thinking, information literacy, and the art of communication. We not only learn what we think, but.
Again, this is not to say that there are no places for AI in education. Now that people have access to generative AI, it’s wise to teach them what it does well and where it struggles rather than ignore its existence altogether.
Ultimately, many suggest that the key in our current climate is to emphasize that writing is learning, and learning is a process that requires time. As John Warner , "Speed and efficiency are not educational values. When it comes to writing, what matters is the writing. When it comes to learning, what matters is the learning."
## The Human Element In Business Innovation
A similar approach might be beneficial for business leadership when they consider how and when to deploy AI in their processes. I think business leaders should consider the ultimate goal of the task they seek to outsource to AI; if the task is repetitive or the goal is brainstorming, AI technologies may save time or help employees generate better ideas more quickly. But if the goal is true innovation, there’s simply no replacement for human creativity.
Copilot may be here to stay, or it may quietly disappear like its chirpy forebear, Clippy. Whatever its fate, AI technologies will undoubtedly transform, as they have already with the introduction of ChatGPT’s Deep Research function. Perhaps someday, AI technology will be advanced enough to simulate the wonderful weirdness of the individual human brain.
But even with all the tools of generative AI at your fingertips, if you do not possess the ability to think critically and creatively, you cannot use these technologies effectively. And if businesses want employees to learn skills like reasoning and synthesis for themselves, if they want them to learn who they are and what matters to them, they will continue to have them write.

## Topline
Nvidia shares fell Monday, diving further into correction territory despite reporting stronger-than-expected headline last Wednesday, as the artificial intelligence leader headlines broader stock market losses as investors reassess risks tied largely to President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
![Stock Markets Open The Week After Dow Jumped 600 Points On Friday](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67c617ae86b4e10577bb6c6d/Stock-Markets-Open-The-Week-After-Dow-Jumped-600-Points-On-Friday/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1650,928,x0,y28,safe&width=144)

## Key Facts
Nvidia stock fell 8.7% to about $114 per share, closing at its lowest share price since mid September.
Catalyzing the Monday drop was a from The Wall Street Journal on Chinese buyers skirting U.S. export controls on Nvidia’s highly sought after AI chip technology, with Trump’s afternoon vow to implement 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports accelerating an across-the-board selloff Monday.
Nvidia led broader losses Monday, as the benchmark S&P 500 fell 1.8% and the tech-concentrated Nasdaq dropped 2.6%, with most of the losses Trump’s afternoon announcement that the tariffs will take effect Tuesday.
The S&P closed Monday at its lowest level since Jan. 14, the Nasdaq notched its lowest close since Nov. 4 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which declined 1.5% (640 points) Monday, sank to its lowest price since Jan. 16.
The S&P and Nasdaq are down 4.8% and 8.5% from their respective all-time closing highs set Feb. 19.
Monday was the S&P’s biggest percentage loss of 2025.
## Surprising Fact
The bellwether S&P has given up almost all of its post-election gains, closing just 1.2% above where it stood Election Day, excluding dividends. The index is down 2.5% from Trump’s second inauguration.
## Big Number
More than $600 billion. That’s how much market capitalization Nvidia has lost since Feb. 19. Nvidia lost its mantle as the world’s second most valuable public company Monday, slipping behind Microsoft. Nvidia is worth about $800 billion less than Apple, which has a market capitalization of $3.6 trillion. Nvidia was worth more than Apple as recently as January.
## Forbes Valuation
Nvidia cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth fell by $10 billion to $99 billion Monday, according to our estimates. Huang, who is the 16th-richest person in the world, has gotten about $24 billion poorer since Feb. 20, when he was the 11th-wealthiest person.
## Key Background
Shares of Nvidia have declined 13% since last Wednesday’s earnings report and 18% since Feb. 19, before the U.S. stock market began to deflate. The poster child of 2023’s and 2024’s bull market, Nvidia has become the face of the recent pullback as Wall Street’s risk appetite . Nvidia consensus estimates for fourth-quarter profit and revenue and guided for higher sales during the current quarter than analysts expected. But the report left investors “a couple things to pick at,” noted UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri, including weaker gross profit margins. And pick they did, as Nvidia stock declined 8.5% in the first trading session following earnings. Nvidia is the undisputed market leader in designing the semiconductor technology powering the generative AI revolution, but it received a significant ding in the eyes of investors in January as the of the efficient DeepSeek AI model from China stoked fears about softer demand for Nvidia’s expensive technology.

It’s easy to get caught up worrying over headlines about inflation, high costs, toxic politics, fears of a world war, and general uncertainty. These and even more concerns constantly weigh on many Americans’ minds. However, if you step back, you’ll see a different story. The US has a long history of resilience, opportunity, and innovation. Despite the challenging hurdles, , economy, and future. From thriving industries to new ways of working. We can shine a light on the positive forces shaping a promising tomorrow.
Across the country, that pay well and afford people to work on cutting-edge innovations. Hospitals are hiring nurses and tech specialists at record rates, tech companies are building the future with AI and automation, and green energy firms are looking for talent to drive sustainability. These industries aren’t just surviving—they’re growing, offering pathways for Americans to find meaningful, secure work.
. Companies across the board have embraced hybrid models, meaning you can work from a sunny porch instead of a costly commute. This saves money—sometimes thousands a year on gas and lunches—and opens up jobs in other cities or states without uprooting your life. It’s not just about convenience; it’s about freedom to design a workday that fits your needs, giving you more time for family, hobbies, or just a breather.

Some employers are starting to value skills over degrees. Whether you’re diving into coding, digital marketing, or project management, you can boost your resume without a pricey degree. It’s a chance to reinvent yourself on your own terms and pace.
### **Entrepreneurial Spirit, Tech and Innovation**
Tough times have sparked an at record rates. Platforms like Upwork and Etsy make it simple to sell your skills or crafts globally. Whether it’s freelance writing, making custom jewelry, or starting a food truck, people are finding financial independence and joy in building something of their own. Every small win feels like a big step toward a brighter future.
MORE FOR YOU
Technology isn’t just changing the world—it’s creating jobs we couldn’t have imagined a decade ago. AI needs ethics experts, green tech needs engineers, and cybersecurity needs protectors. These opportunities come with solid pay and a sense of purpose, letting you be part of something bigger. Plus, businesses investing in tech and R&D are betting on growth, which means more opportunities for those willing to jump in.
### **Better Benefits and Workplaces**
More employers are stepping up with benefits that actually matter. This includes mental health support, generous paid leave, even wellness stipends for gym memberships or meditation apps. These perks aren’t just nice-to-haves—they’re signs of a workplace that values you as a person, not just a worker. Companies like Netflix and Patagonia lead the way, proving you can thrive professionally without burning out.
### **The Land Of Innovation**
Americans have created groundbreaking innovations that reflect the country's ongoing spirit of ingenuity. For instance, advancements in electric vehicles have been led by companies like Tesla. In space exploration, SpaceX and Blue Origin are pushing the boundaries of space travel. American tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook have made significant strides in artificial intelligence. Tech companies are working on quantum computing technology, which promises to solve complex problems that are currently unsolvable with traditional computers. These are just some examples highlighting the innovative spirit and technological advancements that are now common in the United States.

Indiana Jones and the Great Circle
Credit: STEAM
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has been one of the biggest hits on Xbox released in the past year, and it appears the expansion to the PlayStation 5 is coming pretty soon.
Microsoft revealed that the new Indiana Jones game, released exclusively on Xbox Series X/S and PC, has just eclipsed the 4-million-player mark since its launch in December 2024.
Now, the next step appears to be the anticipated PlayStation 5 release.. The game is expected to release on April 17, thanks to an ESRB leak unearthed by . After the leaks surfaced, speculation suggests pre-orders for the new Indiana Jones game might begin later this month—more specifically, on March 25.
PROMOTED
While not confirmed, the upcoming PS5 version is expected to come in two editions: Standard at the usual $69.99 price point and a Premium Edition at $99.99. The bigger edition is expected to offer two days of early access, beginning on April 15.
Both the Standard and Premium editions are expected to offer digital and physical release options.
Upon release on Xbox and PC, the game received high marks from critics. On Metacritic, it received an with giving it a perfect 100 score. The Great Circle has been lauded for its visual appeal, pace, action and story. West wrote:

> "It’s been over a decade since the last Indiana Jones game (and longer since Games peered outside of the Star Wars universe), and the Great Circle only serves to highlight what we've been missing out on for all these years. With its luxurious production values, smart pacing, strong stealth-action, and expansive structure, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle shows that there's still plenty left for Lara Croft and Nathan Drake to learn about raiding tombs from the master." 
In playing the game and watching gameplay, the one thing that pops off the screen is the way the spirit of the IP.
Thanks to the PS5 release, it seems fans of the game might also receive new content to add to the adventure. There are rumors of DLC that will expand Indy’s never-ending story. With the success of The Great Circle, there is hope that Disney might be encouraged to lean into more Indiana Jones projects, and the future of the franchise on all platforms could be bright.
If The Great Circle does land on PS5 in April, it appears to be headed for a sweet spot in the console’s title release schedule. Very few major titles are set for release in April, with Fatal Fury: City of Wolves, which has been somewhat bolstered by its connection to Riyadh Season and Turki Alalshikh’s boxing exploits, and the intriguing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 on April 24.
Nonetheless, the star power and critical acclaim powering The Great Circle should make its PS5 release a hit and one of the biggest stars for Sony in April. If the DLC is rolled out for all platforms, Xbox and Steam should benefit from the second launch as well.
