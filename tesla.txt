Tesla: does it benefit from the appearance in front of the White House by President Donald Trump and CEO Elon Musk along with new models of the EV? The price of Tesla stock has been in a significant slide ever since the two began showing up together in White House offices.
You don’t often see the chief executive officers of big USA-based corporations making Sieg Hail hand gestures in public. Enough investors may have decided that billionaire Musk may have pushed beyond the boundaries and this recent selling of Tesla stock may be one of the consequences.

PROMOTED
Although buyers returned today, the price could not quite make it above Monday’s trading range high. This is the seventh straight day below the 200-day moving average and many, many days below the 50-day moving average which is now down-trending. The red-dotted line along the bottom of the chart shows where support may lie: the June and August 2024 lows. Note how the gap ups in October 2024 and in November 2024 (red-circled) both got filled during the March decline. Traders often keep an eye on gap ups and gap downs as targets.

The price has slipped to below both the 50-week moving average and the 200-week moving average, not the most bullish of technical combinations. Although the selling has been intense since the beginning of 2025, the relative strength indicator (RSI, below the price chart) shows that it’s not yet hit the “oversold” level of early 2023.
Although the 50-week moving average crossed above the 200-week moving average in early January 2025, it may be difficult to sustain the momentum if selling persists.

The monthly chart shows that the price has just dipped below the 50-month moving average and closed below it. The red-dotted line at the $100 level indicates the early 2023 low that may not become a support level should the selling continue. Note that the relative strength indicator (RSI, below the price chart) has diverged negatively from the direction of price.

The point-and-figure charts presents price movement from a different perspective: you can see how extraordinary the moves both up and down have been for Tesla, from last year to the present. You get a sense of how the buying quickly and overwhelmingly became selling – and a sense of just how much the price has moved.
The stock bottomed at $182 and topped out at $488 – all in late 2024 and before 2025 had even begun. Since that top, the selling has been so relentless that Tesla has dropped below the blue uptrend line that had been established until this quarter.

Asia-Pacific markets fell on Thursday after a soft inflation report in the U.S. helped two of the three benchmarks on Wall Street reverse course from two days of losses.
The consumer price index — a broad-based measure of costs across the U.S. economy — in February, putting the annual inflation rate at 2.8%.
The latest reading "is welcome relief," said Vishnu Varathan, Mizhuo Bank's head of macro research in Asia excluding Japan.
"Crucially, February's inflation will almost certainly not entail any tariff impact, which means that the relief, while welcome, is redemption for Fed [U.S. Federal Reserve] hawks concerned about price shocks piling on," he explained in a Thursday note.
Looking ahead, Varathan said it is "premature for the Fed to let its guard down at this juncture."
Over in Japan, the benchmark ended the day flat at 36,790.03, while the broader Topix index edged up 0.13% to close at 2,698.36.
Shares of gained as much as 3.60%, following on buying the 7-Eleven operator.
Couche-Tard, which owns the Circle-K convenience store chain, has been pursuing Seven & i for months and put in a $47 billion bid for the Japanese retail giant. This would be Japan's largest-ever foreign buyout if the deal is completed. However, Couche-Tard has so far mostly received frosty reception from Seven & i.
Couche-Tard founder and Executive Chairman Alain Bouchard said the company has had "many discussions" with Seven & i's new CEO Stephen Dacus, "but it has always stopped at the regulatory ask, the thing that we cannot overcome."
South Korea's index closed flat at 2,573.64. Meanwhile, the small-cap Kosdaq fell 0.92% to close at 722.80, reversing course from gains earlier in the session.
Hong Kong's dipped 0.57% to close at 23,463.26, while mainland China's CSI 300 fell 0.40% to 3,911.58, in choppy trade.
Australia's ended the day 0.48% lower at 7,749.10. This is the third consecutive day that the index is ending in negative territory.
Investors are watching Indian stocks closely after the South Asia giant's inflation rate cooled to a as vegetable prices edged down.
Nomura economists Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi note that the latest reading "supports higher Q4 FY25 GDP growth, but the magnitude is still unclear."
Going forward, they "expect benign inflation readings to sustain." They also added that headline inflation should rise to around 3.8% year-on-year in March, while subdued demand, higher crop output and low manufacturing costs is likely to keep CPI inflation below 4% in the first quarter of 2025, they wrote in a Thursday note.
India's benchmark was down 0.18%, while the BSE Sensex was flat as at 1.30 p.m. local time.
Overnight in the U.S., the picked up after the soft inflation report eased concerns about a looming recession and as investors snapped up technology shares.
The tech-heavy benchmark added 1.22% and closed at 17,648.45, while the gained 0.49% to end at 5,599.30. The slipped 82.55 points, or 0.2%, to settle at 41,350.93.

Controversy is not good for sales, says Jim Cramer on Tesla
CNBC’s on Wednesday reviewed analysis from chartist Larry Williams that suggests ’s gains during the day’s session might be the start of a rally.
“If you believe Larry Williams — and he’s earned a lot of credibility over the years — then this is a ‘gentlemen, start your electric engines’ moment for Tesla,” Cramer said.” Assuming he’s right, the stock’s rebound over the past couple of days is just the beginning of a huge move. And I got to tell you, I’m with Larry.”
Action in Tesla shares has been inconsistent since the election, roaring soon after as investors realized CEO Elon Musk would be close to President Donald Trump. But the stock has since tanked, and Cramer said some of the decline can be explained by Musk’s controversial and larger-than-expected role in the administration. Controversy is not good for sales, he added, and the market has largely lost interest in “high-flying growth names” like Tesla.
But the stock started to rebound on Tuesday and continued to during Wednesday’s session, closing the day up 7.60% after recording its worst day since 2020 at the start of the week. Cramer noted that it can be hard to predict Tesla’s fundamentals in part because it trades on the potential of self-driving technology that will come to fruition years from now.
However, Cramer reviewed Williams’ charts, which suggest there could be a bottom in Tesla. He first examined Williams’ proprietary valuation model that suggests Tesla has become undervalued, which in the past has brought out buyers and led the stock to bounce. Another chart displays Tesla’s seasonal patterns, which show that the stock typically start to rally at this time of year.
Zoom In IconArrows pointing outwards
Williams also looked for cycles in Tesla beyond its seasonal performance, using his findings to create a chart that forecasts where the stock is headed.
“Right now, it suggests that Tesla should be ready to rally, maybe furiously, with a pullback creating another buying opportunity around mid-June,” Cramer said. “Larry notes that we’ve seen this wave in Tesla numerous times before historically, the stock’s rallied 80% of the time during this time period, I think that’s pretty good odds.”

# JPMorgan's Scathing Tesla Prediction: Musk's Car Company Will Report Worst Quarterly Deliveries In 3 Years

## Topline
This will be Tesla’s weakest quarter for car deliveries since 2022, according to JPMorgan analysts, as the polarizing, powerful role of Tesla boss Elon Musk in President Donald Trump’s administration increasingly weighs on Tesla in the eyes of Wall Street.
![US-POLITICS-TRUMP-TESLA](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67d1c4a3906c3ba0848026ac/US-POLITICS-TRUMP-TESLA/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2770,1559,x0,y39,safe&width=144)

## Key Facts
In a Wednesday note to clients, the JPMorgan group led by Ryan Brinkman lowered its forecast for Tesla’s first-quarter deliveries by 20% from 444,000 to 355,000, significantly below the consensus analyst projection of 430,000, according to FactSet.
JPMorgan’s prediction calls for Tesla’s lowest deliveries since 2022’s third quarter and an 8% decline from 2024’s first quarter.
The negative shift comes as Tesla faces the "acute" effects of Musk's "more divisive new role in government," explained Brinkman, alluding to Musk’s role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
Tesla sales in Europe are “under far greater pressure than at home as a consequence of statements by Musk pertaining to the war in Ukraine, U.S. participation in NATO, and far-right political parties,” Brinkman added, as new Tesla vehicle registrations 50% year-over-year in January.
And “Tesla appears to have the most to lose” among American car companies from the “shifting regulatory backdrop” under Trump, according to the analysts, citing the potential of electric vehicle tax credits which could further cut into demand for Teslas.
JPMorgan’s $120 share price target for Musk’s company is the lowest on Wall Street, according to FactSet data, and it implies more than 50% downside from Tesla’s $248 ticker Wednesday.
## Crucial Quote
“We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,” wrote the JPMorgan analysts.
## Contra
The bearish JPMorgan update came as the badly battered Tesla stock enjoyed a rebound, gaining 7.6%. Its best daily percentage gain since January, Tesla stock led a broader rally across technology stocks as tamer-than-expected data restored some investor confidence. Shares of Tesla are still down 39% year-to-date, the second-worst loss of any company listed on the S&P 500, and 48% from their December all-time high.
## Big Number
53%. That’s the of Americans who hold a negative view on Musk, according to a poll released Wednesday, compared to 35% who hold a positive opinion and 11% who have no view.
## Key Background
JPMorgan is the latest major firm to cut its Q1 delivery forecasts for Tesla, joining the likes of Goldman Sachs and UBS. Tesla stock initially enjoyed a significant bump after Trump’s victory, which brought a close Musk ally to power, as shares gained as much as 91% from Election Day through December, before as investors keyed into the potential negative impact of Musk’s controversial White House role and Trump’s tariffs weighed on the market.
## Forbes Valuation
Musk is still by far the richest person in the world with a $333.8 billion net worth, according to our latest , though that’s nearly $130 billion below his fortune’s peak in December. Tesla is the primary source of Musk’s wealth, though he also holds stakes in his private companies SpaceX, X and xAI.

## Topline
Protests targeting Tesla are growing across the country—some peaceful, while some are acts of vandalism involving arson and gunfire—prompting President Donald Trump to threaten protesters will go through “hell” and be labeled domestic terrorists, as ire against company CEO and DOGE chief Elon Musk swells.

## Timeline
March 11Three Tesla vehicles at a Dedham, Massachusetts, Tesla dealership were vandalized, , with all four wheels on each vehicle damaged and two others defaced with spray paint.
March 9Four Tesla Cybertrucks were damaged in a fire in Seattle, fire officials told the , though the origin of the fire is unclear and under investigation.
March 6At least seven shots were fired at a Tigard, Oregon, Tesla dealership, , which caused damage to three cars and the store’s windows.
March 3 seven Tesla charging stations in Littleton, Massachusetts, sustained heavy damage in fires that appeared to be intentionally set.
March 2Baltimore County Police said was found at a Tesla dealership in Owings Mills, Maryland, which said “No Musk” alongside what appeared to resemble a swastika.
Feb. 2442-year-old Colorado resident was confronted by police and charged with malicious destruction of property for numerous alleged instances of vandalism at a Tesla dealership in Loveland, Colorado, with police finding a “container of gasoline plus a box of bottles and wick material” in her car, according to the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado.
Feb. 19Windows at a Salem, Oregon, Tesla dealership were by a man firing bullets from an AR-style rifle—the second incident connected to the Salem man, who faces a federal weapons , and who police say previously vandalized the dealership in January.
Feb. 11Nelson allegedly sprayed graffiti using an expletive on the front windows of the Loveland Tesla dealership, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, leading to a confrontation with a security guard.
Feb. 7Nelson was accused of using red graffiti on a wall of the Loveland Tesla dealership and a possible arson, with police finding “multiple broken bottles consistent with incendiary devices,” according to the U.S. Attorney’s office.
Feb. 2Police accused Nelson of spray-painting the word “Nazi” on the Loveland Tesla dealership sign.
Jan. 29Nelson allegedly threw a Molotov cocktail aimed at a Cybertruck on display at the Loveland Tesla dealership, causing a fire, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.
Jan. 20The Salem man threw Molotov cocktails at Tesla vehicles, causing a fire impacting one vehicle, police said.
## Did Trump Call For Tesla Vandals To Be Prosecuted As Domestic Terrorists?
Not quite. During a demonstration at the White House on Tuesday, in which five Tesla vehicles were lined up with Musk in attendance, right-wing Real America’s Voice reporter asked Trump a question, stating “some say they should be labeled domestic terrorists.” Trump responded: “I will do that. I’ll do it. I’m going to stop them,” adding, “You do it to Tesla and you do it to any company, we're going to catch you and you're going to go through hell.” Glenn has tweeted critically of the Tesla protests, urging the government to “shut it down immediately” in a , which he made in response to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who posted a letter she and other representatives sent to the Department of Justice and FBI urging them to prosecute Tesla vandals for domestic terrorism. A day prior to Trump’s Tesla demonstration, he said on he would purchase a Tesla as a show of support for Musk, slamming the “Radical Left Lunatics” for protesting the car company, which Trump claimed is “illegal.”
## Could Tesla Vandals Be Prosecuted As Domestic Terrorists?
There is for domestic terrorism, so individuals suspected to have committed acts of domestic terrorism must instead be charged with other crimes. The United States federal defines domestic terrorism as “acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State” that are intended to coerce either the civilian population or government policy, or to impact the government through “mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping.”
## Surprising Fact
Tesla protests have also taken place internationally. Twelve Tesla vehicles were set on fire in , on March 2 in an incident prosecutors say was “not at all accidental.” A Tesla factory near Berlin was set on fire March 5, causing a power outage. A far-left group, Volcano Group, for the apparent arson in Berlin.
## What Is “tesla Takedown?”
Some peaceful protests against Tesla dealerships in cities across the United States have been linked to “,” an organization that urges people to “sell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines,” according to its website. Actor is a key figure behind the protests, which he began organizing in February. He posted on on Tuesday that Tesla Takedown is a “peaceful, grassroots protest movement formed by many thousands of concerned citizens,” hitting back at Trump’s claim the Tesla protests are “illegal.”
## How Has Musk Responded To The Tesla Protests?
Musk has at various billionaires, including George Soros and Reid Hoffman, though he hasn’t provided evidence to back up his claims that they’re behind the protests. In a on Saturday, he claimed an “investigation”—without naming a specific investigation—found Soros, Hoffman, the ActBlue Democratic fundraising conduit and various left-wing groups to be responsible for the protests. On Sunday, he a “heartfelt thanks to everyone supporting @Tesla, despite many attacks against our stores and offices.”
## Key Background
Trump’s Tesla show at the White House came after earlier this week in a rough stretch for Musk. Tesla stock’s more than 12% plunge Monday capped what has been a disastrous stretch for Tesla investors, as the drop meant all of the stock’s 91% post-Trump election victory gain had been wiped out, with Monday being the stock’s seventh-worst day in the company’s 15-year history. The stock nosedive chipped away at Musk’s , erasing $23 billion Monday alone. Musk’s other businesses also took a hit in recent days, as X faced an outage—which on a “massive cyberattack” allegedly “originating in the Ukraine area”—and a SpaceX Starship test flight ended in an for the second-straight time.
## Tangent
Musk has held onto the reins of his various companies, including Tesla, SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter), while working as the Department of Government Efficiency’s leader—but on Monday he is juggling his business and political ventures “with great difficulty.”

More than half of respondents, 53%, rated Musk negatively, while 35% said they have a positive view and 11% had no opinion, according to the March 6-9 of 1,206 U.S. adults (margin of error 3.3).
Musk’s approval rating is below both Trump’s and Vice President JD Vance’s, who are both underwater, with Trump’s overall job approval rating at 45% and Vance’s at 33%.
More than 60% said Musk—who leads the Department of Government Efficiency tasked with slashing the federal workforce—has neither the experience nor the judgement to carry out Trump’s sweeping changes to the federal government, though there are stark divides in sentiment between those who support Trump and those who don’t, with at least 75% of Trump supporters and less than 10% of those who have a negative opinion of Trump saying Musk has the right judgement and experience.
While the majority, 62%, of respondents said they’re worried the Trump administration’s cuts to the federal government will go too far, respondents were largely split along party lines: 90% of Democrats and 69% of independents said they are concerned about losing important federal programs, while 73% of Republicans said they’re more concerned fraud and waste will continue to be an issue.
Four February polls—from , , and —found disapproval of Musk or DOGE outpaced approval, though a suggests Americans have an appetite for government cuts generally, with 72% responding “yes” when asked if there should be a government agency focused on efficiency initiatives.
## Big Number
56%. That’s the share of respondents to the CNN poll who said they disapprove of Trump’s handling of the economy.
## Tangent
Musk’s suggesting he’s eyeing cuts to entitlement programs could threaten to further dent his approval rating, as Social Security and Medicaid are broadly popular among the American public. A January AP-NORC found 67% of respondents said the government spends “too little” on Social Security, and 55% said it spends too little on Medicaid. Meanwhile, 77% of Republican respondents to a recent by the health policy research group, KFF, said they want Congress to increase or maintain spending on Medicaid.
## Key Background
Some Republican lawmakers have about Musk’s sweeping federal government cuts spearheaded by DOGE, while some cabinet officials have also reportedly taken Musk to task behind closed doors about the potentially negative impact the cuts will have on key government services. While Trump has reportedly defended Musk, he also recently told cabinet officials they have the when it comes to firing decisions and layoffs, not Musk. Trump later clarified that if agency leaders don’t make the necessary cuts, Musk will do it for them, “if they can cut, it’s better. And if they don’t cut, then Elon will do the cutting.” Musk’s authority in the federal government is the target of several lawsuits, though the Trump administration has insisted he works in an advisory capacity as a “special government employee” required to work a minimum number of hours each year and is not paid.

More than eight out of every 10 respondents to a Morgan Stanley survey believe CEO 's controversial political activities are hurting his business.
In total, 85% of the 245 participants polled by the firm believe Musk's foray into politics has either had a "negative" or "extremely negative" impact on business fundamentals. The majority of respondents also expect Tesla deliveries to fall this year, according to the survey.
While a small sampling, these results offer the latest sign of mounting frustration with the billionaire entrepreneur as he's become a rising figure in international and American politics. It also comes at a pivotal point for Tesla's stock, with shares plunging nearly 40% this year.
When asked about Musk's efforts with U.S. government efficiency and other political activities, 45% of respondents said these actions had a "negative" effect on the company. Another 40% said they were having an "extremely negative" impact.
On the other hand, 3% said they were "positive" for the business. Meanwhile, 12% called them "insignificant."
To be sure, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas reported that his survey respondents are drawn from his email distribution list and should not be taken as a random representative sample. He also noted that the respondents are not necessarily owners of Tesla stock. The survey was taken over a 17-hour period, starting on Tuesday afternoon.
Jonas also asked about expectations for the company's performance. In a separate question, 59% said they anticipated Tesla would deliver fewer cars to customers in 2025 compared with the prior year. What's more, 21% of total respondents said they expected a decline of more than 10%. That comes as some analysts have raised alarm that recent could 
Just 19% of responders said they forecasted deliveries to rise in 2025, while another 23% said they would be flat between the two years.
Musk's political profile has grown after his public support of President in the runup up to last year's election and his subsequent role leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The Tesla executive's efforts to slash the federal government's spending and workforce has drawn the ire of critics who see his team as working too quickly and haphazardly.
Musk in an interview with Fox Business on Monday that his high-profile role in Trump's administration meant he was running his businesses, which also include X and SpaceX, "with great difficulty." That day, Tesla shares tumbled more than 15% for their

Tesla in 2025
Despite the recent nosedive, 45% of respondents said they anticipate Tesla shares will be at least 11% higher by the end of the calendar year. Around 36% expect the stock to tumble another 11% or further by year-end, while 19% see the stock staying within 10% of its price around $220.
After a New York Times last week unearthed criticisms of Musk's team from members of Trump's cabinet, the president offered a vote of confidence on Tuesday. Trump evaluated five Tesla vehicles after the president on social media that he would buy one as a symbol of support.
Trump also said he would declare violence at Tesla dealerships to be acts of domestic terrorism.

## Topline
A 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports to the U.S. is set to take effect Wednesday, part of President Donald Trump’s push to impose new taxes on U.S. trading partners and an expansion of the metals tariffs he imposed during his first term—prompting retaliatory measures from the European Union that will hit goods from Republican-held states.

## Key Facts
Trump announced the metals tariffs on Feb. 10, prompting the European Union to implement , effective April 1, on goods it taxed during Trump’s first term that primarily hit Republican states, such as whiskey and Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
Trump to impose a higher 50% tax on Canadian steel and aluminum imports in response to Ontario’s previously planned imports that primarily affect Michigan, Minnesota and New York, which Ontario backed off of after Trump’s announced he’d double the metals tariffs for Canada.
The metals tariffs will impact about $150 billion in imported consumer products—from sporting goods to electronics—plus raw steel and aluminum, according to .
## Which Countries Export The Most Aluminum To The U.s.?
The U.S. gets most of its imported aluminium products from Canada (more than $9.4 billion in 2024) —which will be hit by the planned 50% tariffs—followed by the United Arab Emirates ($917 million) and China ($809 million), while the rest of the world supplied just under a combined $7 billion, according to the .
## Which Countries Export The Most Steel Mill Products To The U.s.?
Canada is also the top source for imported steel mill products to the U.S. ($7.1 billion in 2024), followed by Mexico ($3.5 billion), Brazil ($3 billion) and South Korea ($2.9 billion), with around $15 billion sourced from the rest of the world, the says.
## What Could Cost More Due To Trump’s Steel And Aluminum Tariffs?
Aluminum parts for cars, trucks, buses and tractors is the largest import category that will be hit by the new tariffs, according to a of trade data, accounting for $25.7 billion in imports last year. That’s followed by metal furniture and furniture parts ($15 billion), and industrial machinery and parts ($9 billion), though it’s unclear whether companies that use and sell the products will transfer costs to consumers. Car prices could go up by $1,000 to $1,500, Dean Baker, a left-leaning senior economist at nonpartisan The Center for Economic and Policy Research, told . The 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican steel imports could add $6,250 to the average $25,000 price of a car imported to the U.S. from those two countries, Baker told CBS. Meanwhile, National Association of Homebuilders Chair Carl Harris in a recent statement that consumers will ultimately pay for the higher price of building a home under the metals tariffs.
## Which Products Are Subject To The Eu’s Retaliatory Tariffs?
The E.U. will phase in retaliatory tariffs on April 1, hitting U.S. imports it also taxed between 2018 and 2020, it announced Wednesday. The tariffs are aimed at red states and target products including beef and poultry from Kansas and Nebraska, soybeans from Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson’s home state of Louisiana, peanut butter and jeans. The E.U. said it would implement another wave of tariffs April 13 on $19 billion in additional products yet to be identified, for a total of $28 billion, a figure the E.U. said is equal to the tariffs charged by Trump.
## What Happened As A Result Of Trump’s Tariffs On Steel And Aluminum In 2018?
Trump imposed a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports during his first term, but later granted some exemptions, including to Mexico and Canada, before former President Joe Biden partly removed most of the tariffs in place of quotas that trigger additional levies. Prices for both steel and aluminum went up about 2% and imports fell by 24% for steel and 31% for aluminum between 2018 and 2021, according to the , which found U.S. steel production increased by about 2% and aluminum production went up about 4%. The tariffs boosted job growth for domestic steel producers, but led to job losses in industries that rely on steel—which employ far more people combined than U.S. steel mills—such as construction, auto, oil, gas and electric, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. The manufacturing sector lost about 75,000 jobs as a direct result of the metals tariffs, according to a 2020 by University of California, Davis economics professor Kadee Russ and University of Wisconsin-Madison assistant professor Lydia Cox for Econofact. U.S. steel prices rose 5% in the month after the tariffs first went into effect and aluminum prices increased 10%, according to , which found prices returned to their pre-tariff levels within several months, but slower than they rose, with aluminum prices falling faster than steel. The metal tariffs combined ultimately cost taxpayers more than $900,000 each year for every job saved or created, the Washington Post in 2019, citing a study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
## What To Watch For
Trump has vowed to impose reciprocal tariffs on all U.S. trading partners beginning April 2, plus 25% tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada. Trump initially imposed the Mexican and Canadian tariffs on March 4, but paused the plan several days later to give the countries time to meet his demands for stricter controls on illegal immigration and fentanyl crossing the borders. An additional 10% levy on all Chinese imports, on top of the 10% tax imposed earlier this year, took effect as planned on March 4. In retaliation, Canada announced a 25% tariff on $20.7 billion USD worth of U.S. goods that officials said would stay in place despite Trump’s decision Thursday to delay the taxes for a month, though Canada cancelled a second round of retaliatory tariffs that would have taken effect three weeks later. China responded by increasing import duties by 10-15% on several key American agricultural food products and expanding export controls on 15 U.S. firms.

There simply isn’t any private company that can provide weather data at the scale of NWS. Nearly all commercial weather companies, from Tomorrow to the weather app on your phone, rely on its data to power their forecasting models, even those that have their sensors or satellites.
When Elkabetz founded Tomorrow (then called ClimaCell) in 2016, his company was focused on the simple idea: As the climate crisis worsens, damages to businesses from increasingly extreme weather events are going to grow in frequency and intensity. Businesses needed a**timely, reliable way to get weather information** crucial to mitigating its potential negative effects.
Tomorrow’s solution was to create software that can not only provide forecasts but also concrete suggestions for the steps a specific business should take to mitigate weather impacts. For example, it provides its airline customers like United and JetBlue with recommendations for grounding or re-routing flights during major storms. And for the Chicago Cubs, it provides information about weather conditions at Wrigley Field impacting player performance.
**WHY IT MATTERS** “The National Weather Service has long been**the gold standard for weather forecasting** around the world, but experts in the field say that the Trump Administration’s proposed cuts could seriously degrade service,” says _Forbes_ senior editor Alex Knapp. “That creates some opportunity for private companies like Tomorrow, but it’s important to understand that they’re built to serve their customers, not the public interest. That said, Tomorrow’s forecasts and its satellite technology are absolutely state of the art, and companies like it play an important role in helping businesses mitigate weather-related risks, especially in a changing climate.”

Welcome back to The Prompt,
![Signal President Meredith Whittaker said AI agents pose a "profound" security risk, at the SXSW 2025 Conference in Austin. ](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67d0cd34560bd3d83dd30ac2/Signal-President-Meredith-Whittaker-said-AI-agents-pose-a--profound--security-risk-/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1440)

For all the hype they’ve gotten, AI agents— software that can browse the web, operate multiple apps on your device and perform tasks on your behalf— are “haunted” by real security and privacy risks, Signal president at tech conference SXSW in Austin this week. Whittaker said these systems were like putting your “brain in a jar,” as AI agents need to be given access to sensitive data such as credit card information or phone contacts and also require access to use apps on your behalf. There currently aren’t encrypted models to send and receive that data, which has to be processed in the cloud, she said.
Now let’s get into the headlines.
### **BIG PLAYS**
After **DeepSeek made waves in January** , another Chinese AI startup called Butterfly Effect **bubbled up on social media over the weekend** with its demo of an **AI agent dubbed Manus** , which it claims can perform tasks like screening resumes, searching for properties and analyzing stock, mostly on its own. The AI system is **built on top of existing AI models** developed by other companies such as San Francisco-based Anthropic, rather than being trained from scratch. It doesn’t seem like there’s much substance to the hype, as **many people who’ve tried out the tool have reported issues with simple tasks** like or .
### **CHIP WARS**
Social media giant **Meta has begun testing a new in-house chip** , specifically designed to train AI models, in a bid to move away from its reliance on Nvidia’s hardware, reported. Meta, whose family of AI models called Llama reportedly crossed 600 million monthly users last year, is far from the only player designing its own silicon. , and have all invested billions into their own chips.
### **DATA DILEMMAS**
It’s easy to discount the massive amounts of _human_ labor that goes into developing artificial intelligence models. And as the models themselves get better and more capable at advanced tasks, so do the qualifications of those training them. $14 billion-valued **data labelling company Scale AI,** which helps companies like OpenAI, Google and Meta train models,**is increasingly looking for domain experts–including people with PhDs–within the US** instead of outsourcing and hiring contractors overseas,  reported. The shift is part of CEO and billionaire Alex Wang’s new “America first” philosophy under the Trump administration. 
### **AI DEAL OF THE WEEK**
**Lila Sciences,** a Massachusetts- based startup building an**AI system for scientific discovery,** **has raised $200 million in seed funding,** the reported. The technology has been used to run experiments and create innovations across various fields.
Also notable: ServiceNow has acquired enterprise AI software maker for about $3 billion, reported.
### **DEEP DIVE**
**Tesla** shouldn’t be seen as an electric car manufacturer anymore. It’s **an AI company—if you believe CEO Elon Musk.** His confidence is tied to a unique dataset:**petabytes of video harvested from the company’s cars** as Tesla customers log **millions of driving miles worldwide.**
In theory, all that **real-world data** is exactly what Tesla needs to train its cars to operate without any human assistance, a goal that’s core to Musk's vision for the future of Tesla. But there’s a problem: **That data isn’t necessarily as helpful as Musk claims. Some of it isn’t useful at all.**
Building AI that can drive a car as well as a human is a challenge dramatically different than building a natural language processing chatbot like ChatGPT, which was trained on billions of words scraped from the internet. While the goal with ChatGPT and competing systems like xAI’s Grok is to use pattern recognition to provide reliable information and answers to questions, the results often . But **if the AI controlling a vehicle screws up, people can die.**
Driving a car is a very different proposition with many more variables — driving conditions, weather, construction, changing traffic patterns, how other vehicles are moving. Successfully wrangling all those variables, and being ready to react to unexpected developments, is at the crux of autonomous driving AI. Training it on endless videos of people driving down highways doesn’t do much to help the AI learn how to handle what it most needs to: the edge cases that cause collisions or other dangerous scenarios.
Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief AI scientist and a professor of computer science at New York University, also isn’t convinced that Tesla’s data gives it a competitive advantage.
“The impact of data is generally overstated: as you get more data, performance improves, but there are diminishing returns,” he said. “A doubling of data volume brings marginal improvements that are still far from human reliability.” Even with massive amounts of data, no company has developed so-called Level-5 autonomy, the point at which a vehicle can drive itself in all the circumstances a human can.
“Yet **any 17-year-old can learn to drive in about 20 hours of practice,** ” said LeCun. “This tells you that current AI architectures are missing something big in their ability to understand the world and to learn from limited amounts of data or trials.’
Huge amounts of camera data is helpful, but **it doesn’t instantly make Tesla an AI market leader.** “Having access to unique data feeds is certainly some kind of advantage,” said computer scientist Alex Ratner, CEO of Snorkel AI, which makes software to help automate labeling of raw data.
Read the full story on .
### **MODEL BEHAVIOR**
**AI** search engines **fail miserably at citing news stories,** according to a new study by (CJR), which pasted experts from 10 random articles into chatbots and asked them to identify the publisher, article and publication date. **CJR ran sixteen hundred queries across eight AI systems** including Perplexity, ChatGPT, Gemini and others. **Grok was especially bad** , answering **94% of the questions incorrectly.** Even when they do cite sources, people aren’t really clicking through to them. AI search engines direct % less traffic than old school, non-AI Google, as we reported last week.

## Topline
President Donald Trump climbed into a Tesla outside of the White House Tuesday afternoon and said he will be purchasing one for full price, in a show of support for billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has faced legal challenges and criticism—including from Trump’s own cabinet members—over his role as Trump’s cost-cutter-in-chief.
![US-POLITICS-TRUMP-TESLA](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67d09987a546fcbcf9f1e63c/US-POLITICS-TRUMP-TESLA/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2121,1193,x0,y70,safe&width=144)

## Key Facts
Trump teased he would buy a Tesla late Monday night in a in which he defended Musk, saying he is “‘putting it on the line’ in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!”
In the post, Trump criticized Democrats for “trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla … in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for,” saying he would buy “a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American.”
Trump viewed five Tesla vehicles, including a Cybertruck, alongside Musk Tuesday afternoon, climbed into the driver’s seat to see the inside— it was “beautiful” and “everything’s computer”—and answered questions from the press.
He said he will be buying one to have at the White House for his staff to use, adding he “like(s) to drive cars” but is “not allowed to,” likely referring to the Secret Service’s that past and current presidents cannot drive on public roads.

## Crucial Quote
When about the violence against Tesla dealerships and whether those people should be labeled “domestic terrorists,” Trump said, “I will do that ... I’m going to stop them ... They’re harming a great American company.”
## Why Does Trump Want To Show Tesla Support?
The company has faced struggles since Musk took on his role in the Trump administration: Vandalism against Tesla dealerships and cars has been across the country, there were a series of protests in recent days against the company and of the electric vehicles in Europe fell at the start of the year. Tesla faced its worst daily loss since September on as Wall Street broadly saw shaky investor sentiment amid Trump threatening tariffs, and the company wiped out what was once a 91% rally post-Trump’s election. Meanwhile, Musk has faced some pushback for his role leading Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio with the billionaire at the White House last week—though Trump denied there was a blowup.
## Is Musk Still Running Tesla?
Musk is Tesla’s CEO, though he in an interview on Fox Business that aired Monday he is running his various businesses—like X, SpaceX and Tesla—“with great difficulty” while he spends time working as a special government employee in the Trump administration. Tesla traded down more than 15% on Monday and saw its share price drop to a low it hadn’t seen since Oct. 23, but Musk in a tweet the company “will be fine long-term.”
## Forbes Valuation
We estimate Musk has a of about $325.1 billion as of Tuesday afternoon, making him the wealthiest person in the world. We estimate Trump has a of about $4.6 billion.
## Tangent
At the White House Tesla viewing, Musk Tesla would be doubling its output of vehicles in the U.S. in the next two years “as a function of the great policies of President Trump and his administration, and as an act of faith in America.”

## Topline
A of tariffs from President Donald Trump on Tuesday again sent some investors scrambling, as stock indexes tumbled further as the market at economic policy uncertainty.

## Key Facts
The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 American stalwarts from Apple to Walmart, fell as much as 730 points, or 1.7%, by mid afternoon.
The more broadly spanning S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes were dinged less by the tariff news, as the S&P’s Tuesday loss peaked at 1.5% and the Nasdaq’s drop crested at 1.3%.
The drop followed Trump’s social media that he will increase tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%.
All three indexes fell Tuesday to their lowest intraday prices since mid September.
Each barometer closed lower in volatile trading Tuesday, as the Dow dropped 480 points, or 1.1%, the S&P declined 0.8% and the Nasdaq inched down 0.2%.
## Crucial Quote
“You’re going to have drops and markets are going to go up and they’re going to go down, but, you know what, we have to rebuild our country,” Trump reporters Tuesday, referring to the he’s faced as equity prices have faltered thus far during his second term.
## What To Watch For
The benchmark S&P is on the cusp of entering its 10% correction since 2023, closing 9.3% below its Feb. 19 all-time high. “10% corrections usually don’t become 20% bear markets unless they’re accompanied by either an economic recession, an earnings recession, or a Fed hiking cycle,” Morgan Stanley Wealth Management strategist Daniel Skelly wrote in emailed comments. “We’re not seeing any of those right now,” Skelly continued.
## Surprising Fact
The world’s most valuable automaker, Tesla, was immune from Tuesday’s slide, as shares of the electric vehicle firm climbed 4%, bouncing slightly from its recent losses. Also rising Tuesday were shares of artificial intelligence giant Nvidia, which declined 23% in the three-week stretch ending Monday.
## Key Background
Nvidia’s and Tesla’s bounce came after the pair headlined Monday’s selloff as the Nasdaq suffered its worst day since 2022, declining 4%. All three major indexes are down significantly since Trump took office in January, and are in the red since he won a second term in November, erasing what were once robust gains. Trump has to pay little attention to the stock market, while strategists have largely expressed at the lack of policy clarity. Trump’s tariffs will worsen inflation and slow economic output, according to Goldman Sachs economists, who raised their probability of a recession in the next year from 15% to 20% last Friday.

## Topline
A 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports to the U.S. is set to take effect Wednesday, part of President Donald Trump’s push to impose new taxes on U.S. trading partners and an expansion of the metals tariffs he imposed during his first term—prompting retaliatory measures from the European Union that will hit goods from Republican-held states.

## Key Facts
Trump announced the metals tariffs on Feb. 10, prompting the European Union to implement , effective April 1, on goods it taxed during Trump’s first term that primarily hit Republican states, such as whiskey and Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
Trump to impose a higher 50% tax on Canadian steel and aluminum imports in response to Ontario’s previously planned imports that primarily affect Michigan, Minnesota and New York, which Ontario backed off of after Trump’s announced he’d double the metals tariffs for Canada.
The metals tariffs will impact about $150 billion in imported consumer products—from sporting goods to electronics—plus raw steel and aluminum, according to .
## Which Countries Export The Most Aluminum To The U.s.?
The U.S. gets most of its imported aluminium products from Canada (more than $9.4 billion in 2024) —which will be hit by the planned 50% tariffs—followed by the United Arab Emirates ($917 million) and China ($809 million), while the rest of the world supplied just under a combined $7 billion, according to the .
## Which Countries Export The Most Steel Mill Products To The U.s.?
Canada is also the top source for imported steel mill products to the U.S. ($7.1 billion in 2024), followed by Mexico ($3.5 billion), Brazil ($3 billion) and South Korea ($2.9 billion), with around $15 billion sourced from the rest of the world, the says.
## What Could Cost More Due To Trump’s Steel And Aluminum Tariffs?
Aluminum parts for cars, trucks, buses and tractors is the largest import category that will be hit by the new tariffs, according to a of trade data, accounting for $25.7 billion in imports last year. That’s followed by metal furniture and furniture parts ($15 billion), and industrial machinery and parts ($9 billion), though it’s unclear whether companies that use and sell the products will transfer costs to consumers. Car prices could go up by $1,000 to $1,500, Dean Baker, a left-leaning senior economist at nonpartisan The Center for Economic and Policy Research, told . The 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican steel imports could add $6,250 to the average $25,000 price of a car imported to the U.S. from those two countries, Baker told CBS. Meanwhile, National Association of Homebuilders Chair Carl Harris in a recent statement that consumers will ultimately pay for the higher price of building a home under the metals tariffs.
## Which Products Are Subject To The Eu’s Retaliatory Tariffs?
The E.U. will phase in retaliatory tariffs on April 1, hitting U.S. imports it also taxed between 2018 and 2020, it announced Wednesday. The tariffs are aimed at red states and target products including beef and poultry from Kansas and Nebraska, soybeans from Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson’s home state of Louisiana, peanut butter and jeans. The E.U. said it would implement another wave of tariffs April 13 on $19 billion in additional products yet to be identified, for a total of $28 billion, a figure the E.U. said is equal to the tariffs charged by Trump.
## What Happened As A Result Of Trump’s Tariffs On Steel And Aluminum In 2018?
Trump imposed a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports during his first term, but later granted some exemptions, including to Mexico and Canada, before former President Joe Biden partly removed most of the tariffs in place of quotas that trigger additional levies. Prices for both steel and aluminum went up about 2% and imports fell by 24% for steel and 31% for aluminum between 2018 and 2021, according to the , which found U.S. steel production increased by about 2% and aluminum production went up about 4%. The tariffs boosted job growth for domestic steel producers, but led to job losses in industries that rely on steel—which employ far more people combined than U.S. steel mills—such as construction, auto, oil, gas and electric, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. The manufacturing sector lost about 75,000 jobs as a direct result of the metals tariffs, according to a 2020 by University of California, Davis economics professor Kadee Russ and University of Wisconsin-Madison assistant professor Lydia Cox for Econofact. U.S. steel prices rose 5% in the month after the tariffs first went into effect and aluminum prices increased 10%, according to , which found prices returned to their pre-tariff levels within several months, but slower than they rose, with aluminum prices falling faster than steel. The metal tariffs combined ultimately cost taxpayers more than $900,000 each year for every job saved or created, the Washington Post in 2019, citing a study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
## What To Watch For
Trump has vowed to impose reciprocal tariffs on all U.S. trading partners beginning April 2, plus 25% tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada. Trump initially imposed the Mexican and Canadian tariffs on March 4, but paused the plan several days later to give the countries time to meet his demands for stricter controls on illegal immigration and fentanyl crossing the borders. An additional 10% levy on all Chinese imports, on top of the 10% tax imposed earlier this year, took effect as planned on March 4. In retaliation, Canada announced a 25% tariff on $20.7 billion USD worth of U.S. goods that officials said would stay in place despite Trump’s decision Thursday to delay the taxes for a month, though Canada cancelled a second round of retaliatory tariffs that would have taken effect three weeks later. China responded by increasing import duties by 10-15% on several key American agricultural food products and expanding export controls on 15 U.S. firms.

shares rose more than 10% on Tuesday, reversing a three-day slump that coincided with a broader decline among technology companies.
Despite Tuesday's gains, Reddit shares are still roughly 30% below the close on Wednesday.
Reddit's stock market upswing was likely bolstered by a Loop Capital analyst note published Tuesday that reiterated a buy rating and characterized the company's shares as "extremely attractive." The analyst note said that Reddit's 50% drop on Wall Street in the past month "is excessive," and that the social media company "has the biggest upside potential relative to Street estimates in our coverage universe."
The company's shares dropped more than 15% in February after the company weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter user numbers as a result of a that temporarily hurt its search-derived traffic. Although Reddit said at the time that it had recovered from the algorithmic shift, the user number miss spooked investors.
Reddit's shares have since like , and off of concerns related to President 's tariffs and growing fears of a recession. The lost more than $750 billion in market value on Monday with Nasdaq experiencing its biggest decline since 2022.
Loop Capital managing director Alan Gould acknowledged in the note that investors are operating in a "risk-off market environment," but he contended that Reddit "has been one of the top performing stocks over the past year," aside from its most recent dip.
"RDDT wildly exceeded ours and Street estimates for 2024, which explains why the stock increased almost 7-fold from a $34 IPO price to a peak of $230 in less than a year," Gould wrote, noting Reddit's growing revenue and improved advertising tools, among other positive developments.
Reddit's grew 71% year over year to $428 million, which represents the fastest growth rate for any quarter since 2022.
"In our view, RDDT deserves the revaluation it had experiencing based on the growth it has shown in the recent earnings reports and future projected growth driven by the ability to narrow the ARPU gap, and data licensing possibilities," Gould wrote.

## Topline
A of tariffs from President Donald Trump on Tuesday again sent some investors scrambling, as stock indexes tumbled further as the market at economic policy uncertainty.
![Markets Open After Dow Loses Nearly 900 Points Monday On Recession Fears](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67d0610ff155f7ddd9896385/Markets-Open-After-Dow-Loses-Nearly-900-Points-Monday-On-Recession-Fears/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2142,1205,x0,y160,safe&width=144)

## Key Facts
The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 American stalwarts from Apple to Walmart, fell as much as 730 points, or 1.7%, by mid afternoon.
The more broadly spanning S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes were dinged less by the tariff news, as the S&P’s Tuesday loss peaked at 1.5% and the Nasdaq’s drop crested at 1.3%.
The drop followed Trump’s social media that he will increase tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%.
All three indexes fell Tuesday to their lowest intraday prices since mid September.
Each barometer closed lower in volatile trading Tuesday, as the Dow dropped 480 points, or 1.1%, the S&P declined 0.8% and the Nasdaq inched down 0.2%.
## Crucial Quote
“You’re going to have drops and markets are going to go up and they’re going to go down, but, you know what, we have to rebuild our country,” Trump reporters Tuesday, referring to the he’s faced as equity prices have faltered thus far during his second term.
## What To Watch For
The benchmark S&P is on the cusp of entering its 10% correction since 2023, closing 9.3% below its Feb. 19 all-time high. “10% corrections usually don’t become 20% bear markets unless they’re accompanied by either an economic recession, an earnings recession, or a Fed hiking cycle,” Morgan Stanley Wealth Management strategist Daniel Skelly wrote in emailed comments. “We’re not seeing any of those right now,” Skelly continued.
## Surprising Fact
The world’s most valuable automaker, Tesla, was immune from Tuesday’s slide, as shares of the electric vehicle firm climbed 4%, bouncing slightly from its recent losses. Also rising Tuesday were shares of artificial intelligence giant Nvidia, which declined 23% in the three-week stretch ending Monday.
## Key Background
Nvidia’s and Tesla’s bounce came after the pair headlined Monday’s selloff as the Nasdaq suffered its worst day since 2022, declining 4%. All three major indexes are down significantly since Trump took office in January, and are in the red since he won a second term in November, erasing what were once robust gains. Trump has to pay little attention to the stock market, while strategists have largely expressed at the lack of policy clarity. Trump’s tariffs will worsen inflation and slow economic output, according to Goldman Sachs economists, who raised their probability of a recession in the next year from 15% to 20% last Friday.

###  _This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget.__to get it delivered to your inbox every Tuesday._
As the stock market sputters, companies stall on big decisions, consumers pull back on spending and job cuts grow, many are asking the same question: **Is a recession on the horizon?** Even President Donald Trump, whose policies are responsible for much of the economic chaos this year, couldn’t offer a straight answer. In that aired Sunday morning on Fox News, Trump gave a cagey reply when asked if he expected a recession this year. “I hate to predict things like that,” he said. “There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big,” Trump said about implementing his economic agenda like tariffs, adding, “It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.”
The stock market, which was coming off of its in six months based on uncertainty around tariffs, **didn’t respond well to these comments**. , all three major indexes fell—the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.1%, the S&P 500 declined 2.7% and the Nasdaq Composite sank 4%. Tesla, which saw its 15.4% on Monday alone, had one of the biggest declines, erasing the 91% stock gain it had seen since Trump’s election. Monday was the EV maker’s seventh worst day since Tesla went public, and much of investors’ discontent comes from CEO Elon Musk’s seemingly random and uncontrolled slashing of government jobs, contracts, departments and real estate through his work with Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency.
But **declining confidence from both investors and****doesn’t make a recession**. The widely accepted technical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, which hasn’t occurred yet. But last week, that two key financial firms increased their odds of a recession in the next 12 months: Goldman Sachs upped their projection from 15% to 20%, while Yardeni Research raised their recession odds Wednesday from 20% to 35%. Both cited Trump’s policies as the major risk. Another economic threat in front of Washington policymakers: A looming if Congress can’t pass a funding bill by Friday.
“This is a headline-driven market, one that could change in an hour. Sit tight. Buckle up,” Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, wrote to Saul in emailed comments.
Larger economic pressures can drive strategic change, but **so can a new way of looking at the business and its future**. Pennsylvania-based Limbach Holdings has spent the last five years on a major pivot from a construction company to one that specializes in infrastructure management for corporate buildings. The change has paid off in terms of earnings and reach. I talked to CFO Jayme Brooks about her work on the strategy and Limbach’s future. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.
## TARIFFS

**Trump’s seemingly haphazard and deeply impactful tariff policy is the main culprit behind the stock market drop**. Trump has announced or threatened a wide variety of tariffs, and enacted, modified or canceled them with little notice. Companies and countries don’t know if announced tariffs will stand and effective dates will continue, making planning seem impossible. Last week, a new round of tariffs on Tuesday—25% on all goods from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% on goods from China, adding up to 20%. , Trump decided to exempt Canadian and Mexican tariffs for U.S. automakers. , Trump extended that monthlong pause on Canadian and Mexican tariffs to all goods covered by current trade agreements. But , he once again threatened tariffs on Canada—this time reciprocal tariffs on lumber and dairy products.
**Targeted trading partners aren’t sitting idly by**. Canada’s newly elected Prime Minister Mark Carney the country would “never, ever” become part of the United States in response to Trump’s jabs to that end. “We didn't ask for this fight, but Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves…so the Americans should make no mistake, in trade as in hockey, Canada will win,” Carney said. Canada has announced , and many provinces have moved to stop importing U.S. alcohol. The province of Ontario is adding a 25% it sends across the border, impacting customers in New York, Michigan and Minnesota. And Canadians are being encouraged not to travel to the United States, costing the country an estimated $4 billion in revenue, .
**China also retaliated with its own new tariffs and import prohibitions on the U.S.** Last week, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson , “If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end.” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi Trump’s reason for the new tariffs—presumably to stop the flow of fentanyl in the U.S., and said that the U.S. should try to work with China instead of the “two-faced act” of new tariffs.
**This week promises more tariff headaches** : 25% tariffs on all aluminum and steel imports go into effect , and Trump those tariffs will be doubled on Canada in retaliation for the Ontario electricity surcharges.
## HUMAN CAPITAL

**More jobs were cut in February than any other month since July 2020** , from career services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Nationwide, there were roughly 172,000 job cuts last month. As far as February goes, last month’s cuts were the largest since 2009 during the midst of the Great Recession. More than a third of these cuts were in , part of Elon Musk’s cost-slashing actions as part of the Department of Government Efficiency. These speedy and seemingly arbitrary and unfocused cuts have not just impacted federal government workers; CEOs of companies working with the federal government have started to talk about uncertainty caused by these cuts in their quarterly reports, the .
But the government isn’t the only sector seeing deep cuts. **Retail is also seeing them** , with the Challenger, Gray & Christmas report showing 45,375 job cuts announced in the first two months of the year—an increase of 572% over the first two months of 2024, .
According to released last week, **the unemployment rate rose to 4.1% in February** , though its timing doesn’t necessarily capture the full extent of government job cuts. However, the U.S. added just 151,000 non-farm jobs last month, the weakest February growth since 2019 and missing economists’ forecasts of 170,000 new jobs.
## TAXES

**The IRS has its third leader in just over a month** , . Melanie Krause, formerly the department’s chief operating officer, has been named acting commissioner following the retirement of Doug O’Donnell. O’Donnell, a career IRS employee who started with the bureau in 1986, had been the deputy commissioner since Danny Werfel, who was tapped by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate, stepped down prior to Trump’s inauguration. IRS commissioners typically serve five-year terms, and Werfel’s term was up in 2027. He voluntarily stepped down because Trump made known his plans to nominate former congressman Billy Long to the post. No confirmation hearings have been scheduled yet for Long, a career auctioneer with no college degree or formal training in tax, law or accounting.
As tax-filing season continues, **the IRS is shedding employees who do the day-to-day work of investigating, auditing and helping taxpayers**. took a look at how the agency is rapidly shifting into one that looks more political—and could see its 100,000-member workforce slashed in half. Other things that may be on the chopping block include the agency’s Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program, which recently helped Erb and two other tax lawyers to help residents file their income taxes.
## **OFF THE LEDGER**
### **How A Construction Company Pivoted Its Mission And Spurred Growth**
![Headshot of Jayme Brooks with a turquoise and white background ](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67d05eb18b302214824acc64/Headshot-of-Jayme-Brooks-with-a-turquoise-and-white-background/0x0.png?format=png&crop=1002,563,x0,y97,safe&width=144)
Limbach CFO Jayme Brooks.
Limbach Holdings
_About five years ago, Pennsylvania-based Limbach Holdings made a major transition from a construction firm to a company that provides infrastructure solutions for corporate buildings—including HVAC, plumbing and electrical work. The company has been slowly transitioning to do the bulk of its business working with building owners, which it calls its owner-direct business. Limbach_ _on Monday, and had record net income, gross profit and EBITDA, both for the quarter and all of 2024._
_Jayme Brooks joined Limbach as CFO soon after the company made its strategic pivot, and has been there to see its_ _to 27.8%. I talked to her about her work at the company and its strategies. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity._
**Tell me about Limbach’s growth strategy from the financial viewpoint.**
**Brooks:** We’ve been focused on three pillars of our growth. One is the shift to owner-direct, because owner-direct work has higher margins and better cash flow. We were at 80% [construction] and 20% [owner direct work]. Our target was 50-50. We hit that last year. Our target for this year is getting to 65% to 70% [owner direct work]. Doing that gives us that higher margin mix.
The other strategy is an evolved offering. Now that we’re a solution provider, we can go in with multiple solutions to our customers and try to partner with them. They can come to us and resolve any issues they’re having with their buildings and be trusted partners when they need us.
The third is our M&A strategy, really getting a bigger footprint. Ultimately, we want to be a national provider. We have large industrial and hospital customers. We want to be able to service all of their locations. Our growth strategy, from [how] we’re using our capital allocation, is to really focus on that acquisition strategy.
**You’ve had a couple of big acquisitions in the last year. Tell me about Limbach’s M &A strategy.**
Currently, we’re focused on east of the Mississippi River. There’s a lot of space that’s still open. We’ve got offices condensed in certain areas. We’re looking to get a bigger footprint so that we can provide services for national customers. We may not be going all the way to the West Coast, but if we have a hospital in the Southeast region, we can cover all of their locations. From a growth perspective with regards to acquisitions, we’re looking to expand—even in the local market.
We’ll do more of a tuck-in transaction. There’s a lot of buzz in our industry now about a lot of these companies getting picked up by PE firms. We try not to compete in that situation because we are really looking to integrate these companies. That’s where we differentiate ourselves: cultural fit is key. We want the employees of the acquired companies to have the same core values as Limbach does. They have a niche market in their region, and they’re working directly for owners, so they’ll all be in a different lifecycle. We take our platform, and how we do value creation, and apply it to theirs.
We are buying at four, five, six times of adjusted EBITDA, where PE firms can be 10, 12, 15. The sellers that we’re targeting, they’re entrepreneurs, they’ve grown these businesses and want a home for their employees. That’s where the culture part has been really key.
We did two acquisitions [last year]. It’s really finding that diamond in the rough. It’s got to be aligned: the seller is ready to sell, it fits our culture, and it fits what we’re looking for. We’ve done five in total.
**When you started at Limbach, the pivot and new strategy was just starting. What made you interested in joining a company that was in the midst of doing that?**
I came from manufacturing. I did not have any construction background, but I had public [company] experience. That was my focus. I knew I could add value there. I liked the people and the passion they had behind the strategy, and could see the value of where that could go, creating that durable demand in mission-critical environments. There was a real commitment from the management team of being very strict to those market verticals and keeping the company aligned with them.
**What advice would you give a CFO of a company undertaking a pivot or looking for a new growth strategy?**
You have to stick with the strategy, and you have to have alignment at the top. Everybody has to be on board with the strategy.
For us, it’s being realistic about how we can execute. Being a public company, we want to make certain we are delivering our results. We don’t have the data historically because we’re changing, so we have to analyze what we have available, and then to some extent be very realistic—and maybe conservative—until we see certain milestones to know where our growth trajectory is.
We’re trying to be very mindful of the growth, and we need to get that data so that we can support future earnings growth. We get that question often: What does the company look like five, 10 years out? Until we’ve got that data to support what that long-term growth rate might look like, we’re trying to give people direction, but at the same time make decisions and communicate to the market based on data.

## Topline
A of tariffs from President Donald Trump on Tuesday again sent some investors scrambling, as stock indexes tumbled further as the market at economic policy uncertainty.

## Key Facts
The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 American stalwarts from Apple to Walmart, fell as much as 730 points, or 1.7%, by mid afternoon.
The more broadly spanning S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes were dinged less by the tariff news, as the S&P’s Tuesday loss peaked at 1.5% and the Nasdaq’s drop crested at 1.3%.
The drop followed Trump’s social media that he will increase tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%.
All three indexes fell Tuesday to their lowest intraday prices since mid September.
Each barometer closed lower in volatile trading Tuesday, as the Dow dropped 480 points, or 1.1%, the S&P declined 0.8% and the Nasdaq inched down 0.2%.
## Crucial Quote
“You’re going to have drops and markets are going to go up and they’re going to go down, but, you know what, we have to rebuild our country,” Trump reporters Tuesday, referring to the he’s faced as equity prices have faltered thus far during his second term.
## What To Watch For
The benchmark S&P is on the cusp of entering its 10% correction since 2023, closing 9.3% below its Feb. 19 all-time high. “10% corrections usually don’t become 20% bear markets unless they’re accompanied by either an economic recession, an earnings recession, or a Fed hiking cycle,” Morgan Stanley Wealth Management strategist Daniel Skelly wrote in emailed comments. “We’re not seeing any of those right now,” Skelly continued.
## Surprising Fact
The world’s most valuable automaker, Tesla, was immune from Tuesday’s slide, as shares of the electric vehicle firm climbed 4%, bouncing slightly from its recent losses. Also rising Tuesday were shares of artificial intelligence giant Nvidia, which declined 23% in the three-week stretch ending Monday.
## Key Background
Nvidia’s and Tesla’s bounce came after the pair headlined Monday’s selloff as the Nasdaq suffered its worst day since 2022, declining 4%. All three major indexes are down significantly since Trump took office in January, and are in the red since he won a second term in November, erasing what were once robust gains. Trump has to pay little attention to the stock market, while strategists have largely expressed at the lack of policy clarity. Trump’s tariffs will worsen inflation and slow economic output, according to Goldman Sachs economists, who raised their probability of a recession in the next year from 15% to 20% last Friday.

Waymo on Tuesday announced it is expanding its service to include another 27 square miles of coverage around the San Francisco Bay Area.
With the expansion, Waymo will now take passengers around Mountain View, Los Altos, Palo Alto and parts of Sunnyvale, California. The -owned company opened its robotaxi service to the general public in San Francisco in June.
Waymo will initially limit the availability of its Silicon Valley service to users of the Waymo One app who are residents with ZIP codes in the area, the company said. Waymo plans to serve more riders across the region over time. The fleet of vehicles that will be in use in the new coverage areas are fully electric Jaguar I-Pace vehicles with Waymo's fifth generation of self-driving sensors, software and other technology.
"Opening our fully autonomous ride-hailing service in Silicon Valley marks a special milestone in our Bay Area journey," Waymo product chief Saswat Panigrahi said in a statement. "This is where Waymo began and where we're headquartered."
Waymo expanded its San Francisco Bay Area robotaxi service last summer into Daly City, Broadmoor and Colma. Its robotaxis do not yet carry passengers to San Francisco International Airport.
A spokesperson told CNBC that Waymo is in "active discussions with SFO," and added that the company is "working to connect" Silicon Valley and San Francisco to "provide seamless autonomous rides across more of the Bay Area in the future."
Waymo also recently launched a commercial , Texas, just in time for the city's annual South by Southwest festival.
While would-be competitors including 's automaker , and -owned Zoox, are continuing their own robotaxi testing and development, Waymo has of self-driving companies in the U.S. 
Before Tuesday's expansion, Waymo said it was serving more than per week across San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix.
Alphabet doesn't disclose financial results for the autonomous vehicle business, but Waymo is part of its "Other Bets." That business unit generated $400 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 and incurred operating losses of $1.17 billion, according to the company's most recent.

## Topline
Even the world’s richest man has bad days, as Elon Musk faced a litany of headaches to start the week Monday—including the of his social media site, an in his net worth as his primary venture Tesla faced brutal losses, while an awkward TV interview only gave critics more fodder.
![TOPSHOT-US-POLITICS-CPAC](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67d0517fc2f9517b7a2ea4c1/TOPSHOT-US-POLITICS-CPAC/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3791,2134,x0,y43,safe&width=144)

## Timeline
March 10, 8:54 a.m. EDTMusk’s Monday gets off to an immediate bad start as users on his X platform to report widespread outages, with Musk later the crash to a “massive cyberattack” from “a large, coordinated group and/or a country” and noting the problem emanated from “IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area” (cybersecurity expert Cliff Steinhauer Forbes it was likely too early to determine the root of the issue).
March 10, 9:42 a.m.Musk shockingly veteran and retired astronaut Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., a “traitor” after Kelly posted support for Ukraine following a visit to the country, including Kelly’s wife —and even one House Republican, Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., to criticize him, with Bacon CNN Musk’s accusation was “not right” and “reflects bad on the White House” (on Musk’s own platform, his “traitor” comment received only 15,000 Likes by Tuesday morning compared to over 230,000 likes for ).
March 10, 3:45 p.m.Left-leaning watchdog organization Media Matters, a longtime Musk target, X for bringing lawsuits against it in foreign countries as part of "a vendetta-driven campaign of libel tourism,” the suit alleged.
March 10, 4 p.m., the primary source of Musk’s wealth, ends Monday trading down more than 15%, its worst daily loss since September, as the electric vehicle maker became the most notable loser of the Wall Street losses tied to shaky investor sentiment amid President Donald Trump’s tariffs—Tesla stock closed more than 10% lower than it did prior to Trump’s election, wiping out what was once a more than 90% rally, and shares declined over 50% in less than three months.
March 10, 4:30 p.m.Musk sits down with Fox Business’ “Kudlow” and does little to assuage Tesla investor angst, —in a halting way that went viral on social media— that he’s juggling his Department of Government Efficiency role with his positions at Tesla and his other companies “with great difficulty” and invokes Monty Python, adding to “always look on the bright side of life."
March 10, 4:56 p.m.Responding to a thread on Monday being the seventh-worst day in Tesla stock’s 15-year history, Musk , “It will be fine long-term.”
March 10, 10:13 p.m.A federal judge against DOGE for operating with “unprecedented power” and “unusual secrecy,” ordering Musk’s agency to comply with public record requests and increase its transparency.
March 10, 10:18 p.m.Musk the “antibody reaction is strong” to a post suggesting Musk “will be blamed for everything,” including the “incoming .”
March 11, 12:14 a.m. Musk’s bossTrump chimes in to support Musk after his bad Monday, on his Truth Social site he will buy a Tesla “as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American.”
March 11, 8:22 a.m. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, long one of the most outspoken voices on Wall Street in Musk’s and Tesla’s corner, publishes a critical note on Musk, saying patience is “wearing very thin” and Musk “needs to step up as Tesla CEO at this critical juncture” as there’s been “little to no sign of Musk” at any Tesla facility since Trump took office.
## Big Number
$22.8 billion. That’s how much Musk lost off his net worth during Tesla’s Monday nosedive, according to our . That’s more than the entire $22.7 billion fortune held by media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
## Forbes Valuation
Musk’s $325 billion net worth still makes him by far the wealthiest person in the world with a $110 billion lead over the next richest man, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ($215 billion net worth).
## Crucial Quote
“The Musk DOGE distractions” have “created a black cloud over Tesla's stock” according to Ives.
## Tesla Stock Bounces Back Some Tuesday
Shares of Tesla gained as much as 6% Tuesday morning, bouncing off of their lowest close since October, before settling into a 1% advance by 11 a.m. EDT, as the market broadly dropped on Trump’s to increase tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel imports to 50%. Tesla’s 2025 losses are staggering, as its nearly 45% year-to-date decline makes it the worst-performing company listed on the S&P 500, according to FactSet data.

Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Feb. 13, 2025
Danielle DeVries | CNBC
The S&P 500 slid in a head-spinning session for traders as they grappled with new tariffs proposed by President Donald Trump that were in flux throughout most of Tuesday. The trade policy uncertainty has brought the benchmark to the brink of a correction, which is defined as a decline of 10% from its high.
The ended the session 0.76% lower, falling to 5,572.07. At its low of Tuesday's session, the index was 10% below its record close. The lost 478.23 points, or 1.14%, to close at 41,433.48. The slipped 0.18%, closing at 17,436.10.
The S&P 500 was in the green at one point during the trading session before Trump declared on Truth Social that Canadian steel and aluminum duties would double to 50% from 25%, . The president made the move in response to Ontario Premier Doug Ford's surcharge on electricity exported to the U.S.
Later in the day, Ford he was temporarily suspending the 25% surcharge after talking with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
Finally, top Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro said on CNBC on Tuesday afternoon that Trump would not hike the tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum to 50%. The 25% duty that was originally planned, however, would still take effect.
This is the latest in a series of disorderly trade policy moves that have rattled corporate and consumer confidence and weighed on markets over the past three weeks.

S&P 500, 1-day
On Monday, the Nasdaq saw its worst day since September 2022, dropping 4%. The 30-stock Dow lost nearly 900 points. Citigroup this week from overweight, pointing to a "pause in U.S. exceptionalism" as the reason.
"There's clearly a tolerance for pain on the part of the administration in pursuit of trade goals that are not necessarily entirely economic in nature," said Ross Mayfield, Baird investment strategist. "At this point I'm still in the camp that we're not on the doorstep of a recession, but maybe a slowdown or growth scare. Non-recession sell-offs tend to be shorter and milder than the recessionary ones."
added to recession worries Tuesday as the airline slashed its earnings outlook due to , pushing the stock down 7.3%. Other travel-related stocks followed suit with and both off 5%.
Along with haphazard tariff moves, comments from the administration in recent days have stoked investors' fears about the economy. On Tuesday, Trump again appeared unperturbed by the stock market's recent slides. "Markets are going to go up and they're going to go down but, you know what, we have to rebuild our country," he said when asked about the stock market, according to the White House pool report.
Investors are eagerly anticipating the release of February's consumer price index due Wednesday.
"It'll be really important that we don't see an upside surprise on CPI because at this point, the Fed does have plenty of dry powder to step in to cut rates and try to boost demand if the economy were to meaningfully slow," Mayfield added. "But they can only really do that if they feel that inflation expectations and inflation are well anchored."

## Market uncertainty means investors should be cautious on growth, Piper Sandler says
The higher levels of uncertainty currently plaguing the market could lead to weaker GDP, jobs and consumption, Piper Sandler wrote in a Monday note.
With this in mind, investors should tread carefully going forward, said Nancy Lazar, the firm's chief global economist.
"The bad news is that Uncertainty is at an all-time high (ex Covid), and is historically correlated with bad eco outcomes. The good news is Uncertainty always comes back down. But near term, it pays to be cautious on growth … until it comes down," she wrote.
In the same note, Lazar said investors should also heed President Trump's .
"Trump warned of a 'little disturbance' in his speech to Congress, and on Sunday refused to dismiss the possibility of a recession. Treasury Sec. Bessent says the economy is heading for a 'detox period,'" she added. "Don't fight Washington."

President Trump again appeared to shrug off the stock market's declines on Tuesday.
"Markets are going to go up and they're going to go down but, you know what, we have to rebuild our country," Trump said when asked about the stock market, according to the White House pool report.
Before the last few weeks, some on Wall Street were counting a possible "Trump put," meaning the White House would be responsive to the market and take steps to limit sell-offs. However, Trump has said recently that he is not looking at the stock market and that the economy is going through a transition period.

## Cheaper stocks may be a buy at these levels, strategist says
Large tech stocks have been leading market moves through much of the recent sell-off, but investors should consider taking advantage of other groups that are getting caught in the selling, said Angelo Kourkafas, investment strategist at Edward Jones.
"I think the theme of the laggards catching up is still in play. A lot of the domestic midcaps, financials, things that are less exposed to trade … still have that catch-up potential and valuation discount," Kourkafas said.
Of course, some of those cheaper stocks are closely tied to the economic environment. Andrew Smith, chief investment officer of Delos Capital Advisors in Dallas, said he wanted to see signs of economic strength before switching up his currently defensive portfolio.
"Until we get confirming economic data from the leading economic side, we're in the wait and hold pattern. Right now all of our [purchasing managers' indexes] are in expansion territory — they have moderated, but they're not decelerating or in negative growth territory, and that's a positive sign for us. In April, if it shows a more meaningful move higher, we'll start getting more aggressive in our cyclical and value allocations," Smith said.

## Wolfe Research sees elevated recession odds of between 30% and 35%
Wolfe Research believes the risks of a recession are rising.
In a Tuesday note, the firm's chief economist, Stephanie Roth, wrote that she had revised down her 2025 estimates for U.S. growth from 2.2% to 1.6%. Roth cited surprises out of Washington as the reason, including "earlier-than-anticipated tariff policy, with DOGE layoffs and immense policy uncertainty exacerbating the economic hit."
"Following our revision, we were asked whether this may ultimately end the cycle. Our base case is that the cycle will not end, as the economy remains on firm enough footing. That said, we see elevated recession odds of around 30-35%, roughly double the 15% unconditional probability of recession (likelihood of recession at any given time) but still far from the central case," she added. "It certainly feels like the market is pricing an elevated chance the economic cycle is coming to a close. … While the hasn't fully reflected our recession expectations, the and homebuilders have."

Amid signs of weakening consumer and business sentiment from President Trump's tariffs, the possibility of a government shutdown later this week is also weighing upon sentiment, per UBS.
"Markets are questioning the notion that the Trump administration would adapt policies in response to equity market volatility or economic growth concerns," Mark Haefele, Global Wealth Management chief investment officer, wrote in a note on Monday.
Haefele added, "Investor nerves are also likely being added to by the potential for a US government shutdown this weekend, and more headlines about 'reciprocal' tariffs coming out on 2 April."
The House of Representatives is planning a vote Tuesday for a stopgap funding bill.

Stocks after Monday's sell-off could be a good spot for a relief rally, but the longer-term outlook does not look as compelling, according to Oppenheimer.
"The caveat is that we think the next market snapback is likely a trade," Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at the firm, wrote Tuesday. "We have less conviction putting long-term money to use in what looks like the 8th or 9th inning of this bull cycle."

## The market sell-off isn't as dire as it seems, says Deutsche Bank 
Deutsche Bank analyst Luke Templeman argues that the continued weakness for U.S. equities this week isn't indicative of both slowing corporate expansion and a looming recession.
"The upshot is that while the US equity market sell-off will undoubtedly make many CEOs nervous, it does not have the hallmarks of prior sell-offs that were actually associated with a material dip in corporate and 'uncontrollable' economic factors," Templeman wrote Tuesday.
"We run the numbers and show that the majority of companies have been relatively resilient in the market this year," he added. "So, even though the market is legitimately worried about very high levels of economic uncertainty at present, it is premature to predict an extended pause in corporate expansion activity and we continue to expect this to pick up materially in H2 of 2025."

"[Bitcoin] is a short term, liquid store of capital and an asset that can easily be temporarily liquidated to draw cash to cover collateral needs," said James Davies, CEO at trading platform Crypto Valley Exchange. "Once other assets that are more impacted are liquidated, the bitcoin trade gets its liquidity back."
"It's become a super cyclical asset — the first to drop with every bad news [event] as a convenient store of cash, but also the first to recover," he added. "This further underlines why its use as a reserve is questionable but shows it's getting more and more FX-like in its action, so adoption is spreading. It would make sense to expect more volatility over the coming months as the world's trade priorities change."

"Given our expectations for a choppy Spring selling season and growing risks to gross margin due to the challenging macro environment and uncertainty around the MRP spin-off, we believe a more cautious stance is warranted," Rahmani wrote in a note to clients.

## Wolfe Research says Madison Square Garden Entertainment shares can surge 50%
Wolfe Research turned bullish on , saying the stock is pricing in an unlikely stagnation in the entertainment business.
Analyst Peter Supino upgraded shares of the New York-based live entertainment operator to outperform from peer perform. Supino's $46 price target suggests shares can rally 50.4% over Monday's closing level.
"With robust live event industry trends, stable tenants, and reliable pricing power, we see growth and little downside," Supino wrote to clients in a Tuesday note.
Supino noted that Madison Square Garden's events for the first quarter of 2026 are trending above the record set in the same three-month period a year prior, which he said offers a "positive early signal" for the fiscal year. A potential renovation of Penn Station would be a "windfall," he added.
Tuesday's call marks a turn for Supino, who downgraded shares to peer perform after the stock was separated from . While Supino said a consumer recession is a risk for share prices, the analyst said to see any cyclical pullbacks as temporary.

## Bernstein raises price target for Mondelez
Bernstein sees a rally ahead for shares as cocoa costs cool.
Analyst Alexia Howard hiked her price target on the candy maker by $12 to $81, which now implies upside of 18.9% over Monday's close. Howard also has an outperform rating on the stock.
"We believe that MDLZ has significant upside from here," Howard wrote to clients. That's "based on the likely eventual deflation in cocoa costs, which have already started to fall from recent peaks but have yet to stabilize."
Howard also pointed to the company's unique global exposure, which she said provides a runway in markets such as China and India. This diversification, she said, "insulates" the stock from U.S.-specific overhands such as weight loss drugs, tariffs and potential cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Mondelez shares hovered around flat in Tuesday's premarket. Shares have jumped more than 14% so far in 2025.

## Wells Fargo double-upgrades Houlihan Lokey
Wells Fargo issued a rare double-upgrade, calling Houlihan Lokey the right stock to play during the ongoing market volatility.
Analyst Michael Brown upgraded the investment bank's stock to overweight from underweight. Brown cut $1 off his price target to $179, but that still implies 15.9% upside over Monday's close.
"Defensibility, with upside to the M&A recovery, is attractive during periods of uncertainty in the highly cyclical M&A industry," Brown said, using the popular acronym for mergers and acquisitions. "These are the times when HLI's premium multiple most warranted."
In other words, Brown said the stock's valuation is still considered lofty, but its "all-weather" business model shines during bouts of rocky markets. What's more, the analyst said the company's diversification with M&A can help insulate the business and keep margins stable.
Brown's call comes amid a rough patch for the stock, which has dropped just over 11% in 2025.

While job losses from Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency may have sent shockwaves through the market, these mass losses are unlikely to make a huge difference in any upcoming monetary policy decisions, according to Barclays.
"In our view, the bar is high for DOGE-related job losses, in isolation, to alter the FOMC's policy course in the next few meetings. To trigger a move, we think the FOMC would need to see evidence that this is part of a persistent weakening of aggregate labor demand," the bank wrote in a recent note. "The skill and education levels of these workers varies widely, and their geographic footprint is spread throughout the US, suggesting that the private sector will absorb many of these displaced workers."

## Wolfe Research is 'certain' that volatility will continue to dominate the market
Market uncertainty has risen over the past few weeks, and Wolfe Research is sure that this trend will continue.
"Investors are likely feeling 'tariff fatigue' as flip flopping of policy and a barrage of news flow throughout last week has whipsawed markets. While this week could very likely bring about more changes to 'current' policy, it remains certain that volatility and choppy trading will continue to dominate," wrote Chris Senyek, the firm's chief investment strategist.
But the good news? While U.S. growth concerns have been building, Senyek also pointed out that overall fundamentals still look healthy for the domestic economy.
"We continue to believe that the U.S. economy is still solid, on the back of the high-end consumer, which drives roughly 50% of overall spending," he wrote. "While we see the current market action as a 'typical' drawdown for stocks with NDX and SPX down 10% & 7% from highs, technical measures are signaling fear but not a washout."

### **Key News**
Asian equities mostly followed Wall Street lower overnight, except for Mainland China and Hang Seng Tech, as the Philippines and Singapore were hit the hardest.
Yesterday’s market tantrum in the U.S. and China’s subsequent gains overnight, though Hong Kong was nearly flat overall, highlight the diversification benefits of owning China. Were investors prepared for this? Probably not. U.S.-listed China stocks, especially internet stocks, are rallying this morning after a slump on Monday. Mainland investors were net sellers of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs overnight after a record single-day inflow on Monday.
President Donald Trump is reported to be planning a trip to China to meet with Xi in April before a “Birthday Summit” in June (Trump’s birthday is on the 14th). This was not cited by brokers as a major market-moving factor, though it probably should have been. The planning of the trip significantly increases the likelihood of a deal between the two leaders of the world’s largest economies.
PROMOTED
Online recruitment platform Kanzhun reported Q4 earnings overnight. The company’s revenue of $1.8 billion beat expectations handily. Meanwhile, its monthly active users increased by +28% year-over-year. Management’s guidance was also quite strong. Kanzhun operated the popular app “BOSS Zhipin”, which can be thought of as the “Indeed” of China due to its status as a top job-seeking platform. Employment is being highlighted by policymakers as a priority in 2025 at the National People’s Congress, and the platform is a beneficiary. This likely led to management’s cheery outlook that was better than expected, as well.
China’s government bonds continued to sell off overnight. This is a good sign as investors are shifting to stocks.
The electric vehicle ecosystem rebounded overnight after Tesla slumped yesterday. Xpeng gained +9.8% after announcing yesterday that its flying cars, or at least a prototype, could become available next year. BYD's unit sales set a new record in February, sending its shares higher by +1.33% in Hong Kong overnight.

The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes diverged to close -0.01% and +1.39%, respectively, on volume that increased by +2% from yesterday. Mainland investors sold a net -$520 million worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs via Southbound Stock Connect. The top-performing sectors were Consumer Staples, which gained +2.82%, Health Care, which gained +2.07%, and Information Technology, which gained +1.58%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Materials, which fell -2.33%, Real Estate, which fell -0.39%, and Financials, which fell -0.32%.
Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board diverged to close +0.41%, +0.34%, and -0.40%, respectively. The top-performing sectors were Consumer Staples, which gained +2.47%, Materials, which gained +1.09%, and Financials, which gained +0.96%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Information Technology, which fell -0.12%, Real Estate, which gained +0.02%, and Consumer Discretionary, which gained +0.14%.

Tesla Stock Plummets 50% Since December Amid Musk’s Political Ties
NurPhoto via Getty Images
## **Tesla Stock Price Drop: Why TSLA Crashed 50% Since December And The Impact On Investors**
Tesla stock has by over 50% since December, a dramatic collapse that has stunned shareholders and analysts alike. In mid-December 2024, Tesla traded near an all-time high of around $480 per share; by early March 2025, it had sunk to roughly $220. This wipeout erased over $800 billion in market value, the steepest drop Tesla has seen in years. Even Elon Musk’s Tesla shares have not been spared — Musk’s net worth has tumbled by more than $100 billion during the crash.
Given that the rout has drawn widespread attention, let’s dig into the impact of Tesla stock on investors and actionable lessons for managing your portfolio in the face of such volatility.
## Tesla Stock Plummets: What’s Going On?
Tesla’s stock sharply after December’s peak, entering a seven-week losing streak through early 2025. On March 10, TSLA plunged 15% in a single day – its worst one-day drop since 2020 – after an investment bank slashed its delivery forecasts and broader market fears spooked investors, to _Forbes_. By then, Tesla shares were down over 55% from their mid-December high. To put the collapse in perspective, more than $800 billion in market capitalization has been wiped out – a sum roughly equal to the entire GDP of Poland, as Ian King of _Sky News_ . This Tesla stock price drop has made it the worst-performing major tech stock of the period and raised pressing questions: What does this mean for investors?
PROMOTED
## Tesla Stock Impact On Investors: Portfolio Pain And Potential Wake-Up Call
For shareholders, the crash of Tesla stock has been punishing. Investors who are heavily concentrated in TSLA have seen their portfolios take a significant hit. For example, a portfolio with 50% in Tesla stock would have lost roughly 25% of its total value in just a few months due to the plunge. Even index funds and ETFs felt the jolt since Tesla is a significant component of major indices — though diversified funds softened the blow compared to holding Tesla alone. The most extreme case is Elon Musk himself: as the largest Tesla shareholder, Musk’s stake in value, shrinking his fortune by an estimated $130-plus billion year-to-date, noted _Forbes_. While few investors are in Musk’s shoes, many retail traders and institutional funds with outsized Tesla positions have experienced significant losses on paper.
Beyond the dollar figures, the psychological impact on investors is real. Tesla has long been a high-volatility stock, but a 50% implosion over a short period tests even the most steadfast believers. Those who bought in at the peak or added heavily during the post-election rally are now deeply underwater. Some loyal Tesla bulls are treating the drop as a temporary setback (or even a buying opportunity), while more cautious investors are rethinking their exposure. In online forums, you can find sobering anecdotes — for instance, one user on _Reddit_ that his 58-year-old father put his entire 401(k) into Tesla stock, a concentration that proved devastating in this crash.
MORE FOR YOU
Critically, Tesla’s plunge has been a case study of the importance of diversification and risk management. Investors with balanced portfolios (holding a mix of stocks across industries, plus bonds or other assets) likely weathered the Tesla storm far better than those who bet the farm on TSLA. A diversified approach means even a 50% crash in one stock might only trim a few percentage points off your overall holdings instead of wiping out your retirement plan. As JPMorgan’s advisors , a common guideline is to keep any single stock to no more than 10-20% of your portfolio to avoid this kind of concentrated risk. The Tesla debacle has driven home this lesson for many: overexposure to one high-flyer can wreak havoc on your finances when the winds change.
On the other hand, some investors are using this moment to strategize rather than panic. Market experts point out that volatility is the price of admission with growth stocks like Tesla. If you still believe in Tesla’s long-term prospects (and can tolerate the rollercoaster), you might very well decide to hold your position or add to it at these lower levels. Indeed, some analysts remain bullish — for example, ARK Invest famously projects massive long-term upside for Tesla, and Wedbush’s Dan Ives argues that autonomous tech is the holy grail that will eventually vindicate Tesla’s valuation. Tesla’s stock performance has rebounded from steep drops before. However, such optimism is no comfort to investors with shorter time horizons or lower risk tolerance, who have seen hard-earned capital evaporate. Tesla’s crash reminds them that investor sentiment can flip quickly, especially when a stock’s narrative shifts.
In summary, the impact on investors ranges from paper losses and shaken confidence to valuable lessons learned. This leads to the next point: how investors should respond, and what can we learn from this episode to protect our portfolios better?
## Personal Finance Takeaways: What Should Tesla Stock Investors Do Now?
If you’re an investor caught in the Tesla stock downdraft, taking a clear-eyed, strategic approach is crucial. Here are some actionable personal finance lessons and steps drawn from expert commentary:
**Reassess And Don’t Panic Sell** — First, resist the urge to panic sell purely out of fear. Step back and reassess Tesla’s prospects and your investment thesis. Ask yourself: Has something fundamentally changed in the company’s long-term outlook, or is this downturn largely sentiment-driven and temporary? Holding through volatility may still make sense for long-term believers in Tesla’s technology and vision. “It will be fine long-term,” Musk has insisted, suggesting patience if you have high conviction. However, be honest about whether your original reasons for investing still hold. If you’ve lost faith in the direction Tesla is heading, trimming your position on any rebounds could be prudent. The key is to make a calm, informed decision rather than an emotional reaction at the worst possible moment.
**Diversify Your Portfolio** — The Tesla crash underscores the classic lesson: don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio is the best defense against a single stock’s implosion. Financial planners often recommend limiting any stock to 5-10% (at most 20%) of your portfolio. This ensures that no single position can sink your net worth. If you found yourself overexposed to TSLA, use this as a wake-up call to spread your investments. Consider adding broad index funds, ETFs, or stocks from different sectors (technology, finance, healthcare, etc.) so that your future returns don’t hinge on one company’s fate. Diversification can smooth the ride and mitigate the impact on investors when a high-flyer like Tesla hits turbulence.
**Consider Rebalancing** — After a considerable swing, your asset allocation may be out of whack. It’s wise to rebalance your portfolio periodically, especially after extreme moves in any holding. For instance, when Tesla stock was soaring last year, it might have grown to an outsized percentage of your portfolio – a signal to pare back some shares and lock in profits. Conversely, if Tesla now occupies far less of your portfolio (and you still believe in it) after the crash, you could rebalance by adding modestly to maintain your target allocation. Rebalancing enforces a discipline of sell high, buy low. It helps you manage risk by not inadvertently letting one stock (or asset class) dominate your holdings. Many investors do this on a set schedule or when a position exceeds a certain threshold. The Tesla episode shows why sticking to a rebalancing plan is essential — it would have naturally led you to reduce exposure near the top and be more assertive when the drop hit.
**Focus On Fundamentals, Not Hype** — Tesla’s wild ride reminds you to anchor your investments in fundamentals. At its peak, Tesla’s valuation implied substantial future growth and flawless execution expectations. It’s okay to be optimistic as an investor, but temper that by analyzing the company’s performance: Are sales and profits growing to support the stock price? Are new products and innovations materializing as promised? When a stock’s price starts far outrunning its fundamentals, as Tesla’s did, understand that it may not be sustainable. Heed analysts’ warnings about valuation risk. For example, JPMorgan’s Ryan Brinkman cautioned that Tesla’s stock was “divorced from the fundamentals” – if you hear such red flags repeatedly, it might be time to re-evaluate your position. The Tesla stock performance crash was primarily a comeuppance for overly optimistic assumptions. In the future, ensure you invest based on realistic expectations and measurable results, not just hype or a charismatic CEO’s promises.
**Have An Exit Strategy (And Entry Strategy) —** Extreme volatility like this highlights the value of having a plan for when to sell and when to buy. If you’re a Tesla shareholder, decide under what conditions you would reduce your stake. It could be a predetermined price (to capture gains or limit losses), a change in the company’s fundamentals, or even a loss of confidence in leadership. Having criteria in advance can prevent hasty, emotional decisions. On the flip side, if you’re a believer eyeing this Tesla stock price drop as a buying opportunity, set some rules as well. Ensure any new investment fits your risk tolerance — maybe your dollar-cost average to mitigate timing risk, or only commit capital you’re prepared to leave invested long-term. And remember Morningstar’s advice: wait for a margin of safety. Tesla’s stock is now closer to its fair value estimate ($250) but still not a screaming bargain; “we recommend investors wait for a larger margin of safety before considering an entry point,” _Morningstar’s_ analyst team wrote. In other words, don’t catch a falling knife — be patient and demand a price that genuinely compensates for the risks.
**Learn From The Tesla Turbulence** — Treat this as a learning experience for your overall financial journey. Market volatility and stock crashes happen – even to popular, innovative companies like Tesla. Use this time to revisit your financial plan. Does your current portfolio align with your risk tolerance? (If Tesla’s drop kept you up at night, you might take on too much risk.) Are you properly diversified? Do you have an emergency fund and other bases covered so you’re not forced to sell stocks at a bad time? These personal finance fundamentals are as important as picking the following big stock. The silver lining of Tesla’s volatility is that it can instill more discipline and prudence in managing your investments. Whether you hold TSLA, buy more, or cut your losses, make that choice part of a thoughtful, long-term plan.
## **Tesla Stock Conclusion**
Since December, Tesla’s 50% stock crash has been a wake-up call for investors. Understanding why Tesla’s stock plunged helps investors make sense of the carnage: even market darlings can stumble badly when expectations overshoot reality. More importantly, the episode highlights how crucial managing risk in your portfolio is. Diversification, discipline, and due diligence are the antidotes to even the wildest stock swings.
If the Tesla stock turbulence has rocked your portfolio, take a step back and apply these lessons. By staying calm, reviewing your strategy, and possibly rebalancing your investments, you can protect your financial future from the next big shock — whether it’s another Tesla stock performance twist or something entirely unforeseen. In investing, as in driving, it pays to buckle up for volatility and keep your eyes on the road ahead.

Billionaire investor Ron Baron is standing by 's even in the face of its dramatic sell-off. The stock plunged 15% on Monday, its biggest one-day loss since September 2020.
"I can't believe how cheap they are, things that we look at," Baron said Tuesday on CNBC's "." "I was thinking we would make four times over the next 10 years. I think we're going to make more than that now from these prices."
The Baron Capital chair and CEO first invested $400 million in Tesla between 2014 and 2016, and that early bet has made him billions of dollars as the electric vehicle company gained mainstream acceptance. Tesla represented 12% of Baron's entire portfolio across different funds at the end of 2024.
Tesla shares have been on a roller coaster ride since Musk went to Washington, D.C., to take on a major role in the second Trump White House. Tesla a seventh straight week of losses, its longest weekly decline since debuting on the Nasdaq in 2010.

Baron Capital trimmed its Tesla position in the second quarter last year because the holding had gotten too big in its portfolio. Baron vowed that his personal Tesla shares would be the last he would touch when it comes to portfolio management.
"I'm the last in, I'll be the last out. So I won't sell a single share personally until I sell all the shares for clients, and that's what I've done," he said.
Musk admitted Monday he is running his businesses "with great difficulty," as he took on the role of heading Trump's advisory , which is engaged in a broad, controversial effort to reduce and slash employee headcount at dozens of agencies.
"I would hope that he would be a little less visible, but he feels that this is the way he's going to get things done," Baron said of the 53-year-old Musk. "He is more charged up about his business now than he's ever been."

As markets continued their downward spiral Monday, many are wondering: **Is the U.S. heading into a recession?**
A key data point is a model from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta that predicts GDP will shrink by an annualized rate of -2.4% this quarter. Then , like tanking consumer sentiment and surging layoff announcements.
Still, there’s plenty of evidence that a downturn isn’t necessarily imminent. As recently as summer 2023, Goldman Sachs predicted more than a 30% chance of a recession, right before the U.S. saw seven consecutive quarters of more than 1.5% GDP growth.
### FIRST UP

Wall Street , with all three major U.S. stock indexes **closing at their lowest prices in months** after President Donald Trump declined to rule out a recession in a Fox News interview over the weekend. The Nasdaq is in correction territory after falling 13% from its closing price on February 19, the S&P 500 is down 9% during that period, and the Dow is down 6%.
Tesla , as **shares of the electric vehicle maker declined** more than 15% amid the stock market’s broader losses. It was the seventh-worst day in the company’s 15-year trading history, as a note from UBS analyst Joseph Spak called for the firm’s 2025 vehicle deliveries to decline by 5%.

### WEALTH + ENTREPRENEURSHIP

China **has a new richest man** ,according to _Forbes’_ estimates: , whose fortune has grown to $65.5 billion.

Congress **to avoid a government shutdown** , as President Donald Trump encouraged Republicans to unify behind a GOP-backed resolution that would largely keep current fiscal year 2024 funding levels in place until the end of September. Republicans can only afford to lose one vote in the House if all Democrats vote against it, and at least one House Republican has vowed not to support the bill.
Ontario will place a starting next week, the province’s Premier Doug Ford said Monday—the latest retaliatory measure in response to Trump’s tariffs on Canada.

A federal judge ruled that Elon Musk’s , as it is likely covered under the Freedom of Information Act—**a major win for watchdog groups**. The judge, who said DOGE’s operations were being carried out with “unusual secrecy,” rejected the argument that the agency was an arm of the president's executive office, saying that its records must be subject to the transparency law.
### WORLD
Rodrigo Duterte, the former president of the Philippines, was on Tuesday after the International Criminal Court issued a warrant against him as part of an investigation into **accusations of crimes against humanity** related to the former leader’s deadly war on drugs. In 2022, the Philippine government disclosed that a total of 6,252 people were killed during Duterte's “antidrug operations,” although the Human Rights Watch believes the number to be much higher.
## **DAILY COVER STORY**
ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER FOR FORBES
**TOPLINE** DOGE’s cost-cutting efforts **have already targeted the IRS** , and reports have spread about cutting the agency’s workforce by as much as half. But _Forbes’_ Kelly Phillips Erb, a tax attorney, recently volunteered in Alaska as part of an effort to help residents prepare their tax returns for free, and she writes that it demonstrates why taxpayer service isn’t a frill.
The Alaska volunteer effort is run by the tax-exempt Alaska Business Development Center in concert with the American Bar Association Section of Taxation, getting help from the IRS’ Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) grant program. For the 2025 fiscal year, the IRS awarded $53 million in such grants to 315 VITA organizations and 41 groups participating in a sister program, Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE). In 2023, grant recipients from the programs **helped taxpayers file more than 2.1 million tax returns**.
Whether the looming IRS budget cuts will leave room to support taxpayer services like VITA and TCE is an open question.
Many families would not have been able to file their taxes without VITA volunteers. While some owed taxes, many others were filing to receive a refund. Former IRS Commissioner John Koskinen often said that the refund due to some taxpayers is**one of the largest checks** they receive all year.
Often, families who qualify for those credits and refunds can’t afford to engage a paid preparer—or if they do, their refund may be eaten up by fees. That’s where VITA volunteers make a big difference, since they can prepare most Form 1040 returns.
**WHY IT MATTERS** “Our tax system can be complicated,” says Phillips Erb. “And many families may face situations that are too complicated for DIY software, and they cannot afford—or, as in some parts of the country like rural Alaska, may not be able to find—a qualified tax preparer near them to help file their taxes.”
“So, why should those taxpayers who don’t directly benefit from VITA care about the program? The U.S. income tax system **is built on voluntary compliance** —nearly 85% of taxpayers file and pay on time each year. Programs like VITA make it easier for taxpayers to keep those numbers up and our tax gap down. That’s good for everyone.”

## FACTS + COMMENTS
The U.S. is seeing —less than half of what was predicted for February—setting the stage for **billions in economic losses this year**.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged citizens to reconsider visiting the U.S. after President Donald Trump levied tariffs on the country:
**23%:** The drop in the number of Canadians taking road trips into the U.S. last month compared to February 2024
**$20.5 billion:** The amount Canadian visitors, the largest group of foreign inbound tourists to the U.S., spent last year
**More than $4 billion:** The amount the U.S. economy could lose in 2025 if there is a sustained decline of more than 20% in Canadian visitors, according to the U.S. Travel Association
## STRATEGY + SUCCESS
If you feel like you’ve been doing a good job , make sure you are **explicit about your career goals with your manager**. Before that conversation, prepare a list of recent contributions to the team. Work with your boss to create a roadmap to your next position, and start acting like a leader even before you officially land the role. When the right opportunity arises, you’ll have already proven your leadership skills.

has become, in some people’s words, President Donald Trump’s ‘.’ But the Trump administration’s moves to strip away a lot of EV-friendly policies have led some Tesla investors, analysts, and EV researchers to insist this will all be disastrous for the company, the largest U.S. EV maker by far.
More bullish analysts say otherwise: That presence could be a boon for Tesla, whose future lies in autonomous driving and robotics.
“The story for Tesla going forward is autonomous and robotics, and we’ve never viewed Tesla as an automobile company,” said Wedbush senior analyst Dan Ives.
Having , “massively changes the regulatory environment for autonomous vehicles,” he added.
“I think that you actually have a federal roadmap that will be created, which speaks to our view that the bet for the ages was Musk’s bet on Trump,” he said.
More bearish analysts and investors aren’t so sure.
Gerber Kawasaki CEO Ross Gerber is one of them. Gerber told CNBC his firm holds about 280,000 shares of Tesla, which is just over half of what he had at the stock’s highest point.
“I don’t see where Tesla goes from here, because the fact is autonomy doesn’t work — still doesn’t work,” Gerber said. “I literally take my . I can’t drive five minutes without having to disengage. And then the Waymos are just like driving around me like crazy. And I’m like, we’re just not there. And I don’t think the hardware is going to get us there and people aren’t buying the vehicles.”
People aren’t buying the vehicles, in Gerber’s opinion, because of Musk’s Trump support and his activity in the White House.
“Elon is probably the most hated person in the world,” he said. “Most people around the world, you know, hate Elon. And the way they’re taking it out is on Tesla. And it’s a really unfortunate thing.”

Data shows Tesla sales have fallen in several European countries — by as much as 60% in Germany in the first two months of 2025 over the same period the previous year.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration is taking aim at policies that have helped EV makers like Tesla. The administration issued an executive order on January 20 looking at “the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs”.
At least one variant of every model that Tesla sells is eligible for the federal credit, more than any other automaker.
“If President Trump gets rid of the $7,500 credit, every single Tesla car just increased by $7,500,” said GLJ Research’s Gordon Johnson. “It doesn’t matter how you spin it. That is a huge negative, given, I think, 60% of America can’t afford an unexpected $600 bill.”
Tesla has made billions by selling government-mandated credits to other automakers.
At both the federal and state levels, government rules mandate that automakers sell a certain percentage of low-emission or zero-emission vehicles. If they can’t meet the quotas, they have to buy credits from another automaker that does. Since Tesla makes only EVs, it has made a lot of what Gerber calls “free money” selling these credits to other legacy automakers. Tesla pulled in more than $2.7 billion alone from these credits in 2024. Though it is a small share of Tesla’s $97.7 billion revenue that year, Johnson said much of Tesla’s free cash flow is from these credits.
“Our analysis suggests over the life of Tesla, if you take out these EV credits their free cash flow is actually negative,” Johnson said.
Trump’s January order also requested a government pause on the disbursement of funds for electric vehicle charging.
Tesla has received about $31 million from the program, a Biden-era federal program to fund the buildout of charging facilities around the U.S. Tesla got about 6% of all the program’s funds.
Bulls argue the disappearance of the EV tax credits, regulatory credits, and even charging funds, either won’t substantially hurt, or will even help, Tesla by knocking out competitors that don’t have the scale to build EV’s profitably.
“Tesla is the only one making money,” said Stifel Managing Director Stephen Gengaro. “They can afford to incentivize sales and cut costs.”

### Trump says he's buying a Tesla to support Elon Musk and counter 'illegal' boycott of EV maker

President shared his intent to purchase a on Tuesday to support as the electric vehicle maker's sales and share price face pressure from the CEO's foray into global politics, most notably as head of Trump's cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency.
"I'm going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American," Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.
Trump said "radical left lunatics" are "illegally and collusively" boycotting Tesla, which the president described as one of the best automakers in the world. This action, Trump said, was meant as an attack on Musk and what he stands for.
Trump also said that he would deem violence against Tesla dealerships to be domestic terrorism, according to .
It is not illegal for consumers to boycott companies. The Supreme Court in 1982 the First Amendment protects Americans' rights to protest private businesses.
Musk's support of Trump in the run-up to last year's presidential election and subsequent leadership in his government efficiency initiative has sparked backlash. Analysts have cited this reputational shift as a driver of trouble for the automaker's stock, which posted its and is down about 43% in 2025.
Musk acknowledged the hit to his businesses , saying he was running them "with great difficulty" because of his high-profile role with this administration. He told Fox Business that as head of DOGE, "you're giving up your other stuff."

"When people's cars are in jeopardy of being keyed or set on fire out there, even people who support Musk or are indifferent [toward] Musk might think twice about buying a Tesla," Baird analyst Ben Kallo on CNBC's "."
Trump said in his post that Musk is doing a "fantastic job" and "putting it on the line" to help the U.S. His comments follow a last week that unveiled criticisms from Cabinet members of Musk's government efficiency initiatives.
Tesla shares advanced 3.8% in Tuesday trading, snapping a three-day losing streak. In addition to Trump's promotion of Tesla, the stock may have also been helped by advising them to pick up shares after the steep decline.

The Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency claims to be streamlining the federal government's spending. But it has so far sown confusion, with the Trump administration attempting to rehire employees it had previously fired.

Global market volatility and geopolitical turbulence in the wake of President Donald Trump's return to the White House have led to warnings that the U.S. economy could be heading for a recession — but economists say that a downturn isn't in the cards just yet.
"I don't think we will talk about a U.S. recession. The U.S economy is resilient, I would say, largely despite Donald Trump," Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Monday.
"U.S. consumers have money to spend, [and] they probably will. The labor market in the U.S. remains reasonably firm, and with energy prices coming down a bit and probably some tax cuts and deregulation coming, I don't think there's an imminent recession risk," according to Schmieding.
